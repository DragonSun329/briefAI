# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Verification Checklist

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Status**: Ready for Streamlit Cloud deployment
**Latest Commit**: dc13d93 - Add Streamlit fixes documentation

---

## What Was Fixed

✅ **All three critical issues resolved in code:**

1. **Chatbox API Failure** → Fixed by replacing Anthropic with ProviderSwitcher (Kimi)
2. **Search Results Hidden** → Fixed by moving results to main area from Tab 2
3. **PDF Unicode Crash** → Fixed by removing PDF export feature entirely

---

## Deployment Steps (USER ACTION REQUIRED)

### Step 1: Update Streamlit Cloud Secrets

**DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP** - The app will not work without this!

1. Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Find your `briefAI` app in the list
3. Click the **⚙️ Settings** button (top right)
4. Go to **Secrets** tab
5. **Delete** the old key (if exists):
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (delete this)
6. **Add** the new key:
   ```toml
   MOONSHOT_API_KEY = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```
   Replace `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual Kimi API key from `.env` file:
   - Find in local `.env`: `MOONSHOT_API_KEY=...`
   - Copy that exact value
   - Paste into Streamlit Cloud Secrets

7. **Optionally add fallback** (if you have OpenRouter key):
   ```toml
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "sk-or-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```

8. Click **Save** → App will restart automatically

**⏱️ Wait 30-60 seconds for app to restart**

## Verification Tests (USER ACTION REQUIRED)

After Streamlit Cloud deploys (wait 1-2 minutes), test these:

### Test 1: Chatbox Works ✅
- Visit: https://briefai.streamlit.app/
- In sidebar, type a question: "什么是大模型？"
- Expected: Response appears in **main area** within 5-10 seconds
- ❌ If error "回答问题时出错": Check Streamlit Cloud Logs → Manage → Logs

### Test 2: Search Works ✅
- Type in search box: "claude"
- Expected: Results appear **in main area** below summary, showing article count
- Example: "📄 Search Results (3)" with 3 article cards
- ❌ If no results: Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Test 3: Download Works ✅
- Go to **Tab 2: Download**
- Click "⬇️ Download as Markdown"
- Expected: File downloads as `briefing_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- ❌ No PDF button (removed - as requested)

### Test 4: Language Toggle Works ✅
- Look for "🌐 Language / 语言" in sidebar
- Toggle between "English" and "中文"
- Expected: All UI text changes language
- Current default: Chinese (中文)

### Test 5: UI Displays in Chinese ✅
- Page title should be: "AI行业周报" (not English)
- All buttons in Chinese by default
- English available via toggle

## Provider Configuration

**Primary Provider**: Kimi/Moonshot AI
- API: `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`
- Model: `moonshot-v1-8k`
- Auth: `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` environment variable
- Rate Limit: 3 requests/min

**Fallback Provider**: OpenRouter (optional)
- Only activates if Kimi rate-limited
- Supports multiple models (quality/balanced/fast tiers)
- Auth: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable

**Auto-Switching**: Enabled
- If Kimi rate-limited → automatically use OpenRouter
- Exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s)
- No manual intervention needed

---

## If Tests Fail

### Chatbox Returns Error
1. Check Streamlit Cloud Logs:
   - App Settings → Manage → Logs
   - Look for error messages about API keys
2. Verify `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` is in Secrets (exact spelling!)
3. Verify API key format starts with `sk-`
4. Try asking simpler question: "你好"

### Search Results Don't Show
1. Refresh page: Cmd+R (Mac) or Ctrl+R (Windows)
2. Check browser console: Press F12 → Console tab
3. Try in incognito window (rules out cache issues)
4. Verify articles JSON file is loading (Tab 1 should show summary)

### App Won't Load at All
1. Check Streamlit Cloud Logs for import errors
2. Verify all dependencies installed (check `requirements.txt`)
3. Verify `ProviderSwitcher` import path is correct
4. Check for Python syntax errors in recent commits

## What NOT to Do

❌ Don't add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to Streamlit Secrets (app doesn't use it)
❌ Don't try to use PDF export (feature removed)
❌ Don't commit actual secret values to GitHub (only `.example` files in git)
❌ Don't use `sk-ant-` keys (Anthropic format - app uses Kimi now)

---

## Success Indicators

After updating Streamlit Cloud Secrets and restarting:

✅ **Chatbox works**: Type question → Get Kimi response in main area
✅ **Search works**: Type term → See results in main area immediately
✅ **Download works**: Can download briefing as Markdown file
✅ **Language works**: Can toggle between English and Chinese
✅ **No errors**: No "FPDFUnicodeEncodingException" or "API errors"

## Support

All three fixes are production-ready. The only required user action is updating the Streamlit Cloud Secrets with the correct API key.

**Contact**: If you encounter issues, check the logs or review STREAMLIT_FIXES.md for detailed troubleshooting.
