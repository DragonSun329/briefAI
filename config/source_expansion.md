## Summary: New Sources to Add to sources.json

**Total new sources: 15** (5 products + 5 fintech + 4 SV + 1 aggregator)
**Current total in sources.json: 16** (1 product + 15 newsletters)
**Final total: 31 sources**

### Source JSON Template for Each

```json
{
  "id": "source_unique_id",
  "name": "Source Display Name",
  "url": "https://website.com",
  "type": "rss",
  "rss_url": "https://website.com/feed.rss",

## Implementation Notes

1. **RSS Validation**: Test all RSS URLs before adding to sources.json
2. **Access Verification**: Confirm each source is freely accessible
3. **Category Expansion**: Add these new categories to sources.json:
   - `ai_products` - New AI tools and products
   - `fintech_ai` - AI applications in finance
   - `daily_use` - AI tools for daily productivity
   - `strategic_insights` - Executive-level analysis
   - Keep existing: `llm_tech`, `emerging_products`, `tech_stack`, etc.

4. **Relevance Weighting**: Higher weight (9-10) for sources directly actionable by CEO
5. **Next Step**: After validation, add all 15 new sources to sources.json in JSON format

---

## Testing Strategy

1. Verify RSS feeds are working for each source
2. Test that sources.json remains valid JSON
3. Run Tier 1+2 collection with test subset (5 sources from each category)
4. Verify paraphrasing quality on sample articles
5. Then proceed with full Oct 24 backfill
