## Usage Notes for Claude Code

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices:

1. **Always use system prompts** - They set context and behavior
2. **Be explicit about output format** - JSON, Markdown, plain text, etc.
3. **Provide examples** - Show desired output structure
4. **Set constraints** - Word limits, style requirements, restrictions
5. **Include error handling** - Ask Claude to flag uncertainty
6. **Request structured data** - JSON makes parsing easier
7. **Be specific about language** - Mandarin vs. English, when to use each

### Prompt Chaining Strategy:

Many tasks work better as multi-step prompts:

1. **Generate** → 2. **Verify** → 3. **Refine**

Example for paraphrasing:
1. Generate summary (paraphraser prompt)
2. Verify accuracy (quality checker prompt)
3. If issues found, regenerate with corrections

### Token Optimization:

- Use caching for system prompts (they repeat often)
- Truncate article content to ~2000 tokens if needed
- Batch similar evaluations together
- Store results to avoid re-processing

### Error Handling:

Add to all prompts:
```
If you cannot complete this task due to:
- Insufficient information
- Content quality issues
- Unclear requirements
- Language barriers

Return error JSON:
{
  "status": "error",
  "error_type": "insufficient_info|quality_issue|unclear_request",
  "message": "具体错误说明",
  "suggested_action": "建议的解决方案"
}
```

### Testing Prompts:

Before production use:
1. Test with 3-5 sample articles
2. Verify JSON parsing works
3. Check Mandarin output quality
4. Validate fact preservation
5. Measure consistency across runs
