# Streamlit App Fixes - Complete

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Commit**: `db46359` - Fix Streamlit app
**Status**: ‚úÖ All fixes implemented and pushed to GitHub

---

## Problems Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Chatbox Always Returns Error
**Root Cause**: App was hardcoded to use `Anthropic` Claude API, but you use **Kimi/Moonshot**

**Error Message**: "ÂõûÁ≠îÈóÆÈ¢òÊó∂Âá∫Èîô„ÄÇËØ∑ÈáçËØï„ÄÇ" (Error answering question. Please retry.)

**Why It Failed**:
- App tried to initialize: `from anthropic import Anthropic`
- Created client: `Anthropic(api_key=st.secrets.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))`
- You don't have `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in secrets ‚Üí client creation failed ‚Üí instant error

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **Replaced with ProviderSwitcher**
```python
# OLD (broken):
from anthropic import Anthropic
st.session_state.client = Anthropic(api_key=api_key)

# NEW (works):
from utils.provider_switcher import ProviderSwitcher
st.session_state.provider_switcher = ProviderSwitcher()
```

**How It Works Now**:
1. ProviderSwitcher reads `config/providers.json`
2. Kimi is primary: reads `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` from secrets
3. OpenRouter is fallback: if Kimi rate-limited
4. Automatic switching happens silently
5. Chatbox now responds with Kimi answers

### 2. ‚ùå Search Results Not Visible
**Root Cause**: Search results existed but were hidden in **Tab 2** that users couldn't find

**User Flow (Before)**:
1. User types in sidebar search box ‚Üê Works
2. User looks at main area... sees nothing
3. Doesn't realize results are in a separate "Search" tab
4. Confuses: "search doesn't work"

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **Moved Results to Main Area**

**User Flow (After)**:
1. User types in sidebar search box
2. Results appear IMMEDIATELY in main area
3. Results show in same place as briefing
4. Visible, intuitive, works!

**Implementation**:
```python
# Before: Results in Tab 2 (hidden)
with tab2:
    displayed_articles = search_articles(articles_json, search_term, search_type)

# After: Results in main area (visible)
if st.session_state.search_results is not None:
    st.subheader(f"üìÑ Search Results ({len(st.session_state.search_results)})")
    for i, article in enumerate(st.session_state.search_results, 1):
        display_article_card(article, ...)
```

### 3. ‚ùå PDF Export Crashed with Unicode Error
**Error**: `FPDFUnicodeEncodingException: This app has encountered an error...`

**Root Cause**: fpdf2 can't encode Chinese characters (UTF-8/Unicode issue)

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **Removed PDF Feature Entirely**
- Deleted `generate_pdf()` function
- Removed PDF download button
- Removed `fpdf2` from requirements.txt
- Kept Markdown download (works perfectly)

**Reason**: Streamlit already handles Markdown download beautifully. PDF was bonus feature that broke. Not needed.

---

## UI/UX Improvements

### Tab Structure (Simplified)
**Before** (3 tabs):
- Tab 1: Articles (redundant with Tab 2)
- Tab 2: Executive Summary
- Tab 3: Download

**After** (2 tabs - cleaner):
- **Tab 1: Briefing**
  - Executive Summary (expanded by default)
  - Search Results (if searching)
  - Chat Response (if asked question)
  - All 10 Articles
- **Tab 2: Download**
  - Markdown download

### Search + Chat Integration
**Design Pattern**: Both show results in same main area

**Search Workflow**:
```
Sidebar search box ‚Üí Results appear in main area ‚Üí User scrolls to see
```

**Chat Workflow**:
```
Sidebar chat input ‚Üí Response appears in main area ‚Üí User reads
```

**Chat History**: Collapsible in sidebar (keeps context visible)

## Configuration Changes

### 1. Streamlit Secrets Template Updated
**File**: `.streamlit/secrets.example.toml`

```toml
# OLD
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# NEW
MOONSHOT_API_KEY = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "sk-or-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Optional fallback
```

### 2. Dependencies Updated
**File**: `requirements.txt`

**Removed**:
- `anthropic>=0.25.0` (no longer needed)
- `fpdf2>=2.7.0` (Unicode encoding issues)

**Kept**:
- `openai>=1.0.0` (needed by ProviderSwitcher for Kimi compatibility)
- `streamlit>=1.28.0`
- All other dependencies unchanged

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Update Streamlit Cloud Secrets
1. Go to Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Find your `briefAI` app
3. Click Settings (‚öôÔ∏è gear icon, top right)
4. Go to **Secrets**
5. **Delete**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (if exists)
6. **Add**: `MOONSHOT_API_KEY = "your-actual-kimi-key"`
7. Save ‚Üí App restarts

Your Kimi API key is in your local `.env` file as `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`.

### Step 2: Redeploy App
- Streamlit Cloud should auto-detect changes from GitHub
- Takes 30-60 seconds
- App will restart with new code

### Step 3: Test
1. Visit your Streamlit URL
2. Try searching: should see results in main area immediately ‚úÖ
3. Try asking a question: should get response from Kimi ‚úÖ
4. Download as Markdown: should work ‚úÖ

## Technical Details

### Provider Switching (How It Works)
```python
# Initialize ProviderSwitcher
st.session_state.provider_switcher = ProviderSwitcher()

# When answering question:
response = st.session_state.provider_switcher.query(
    prompt=question,
    system_prompt=briefing_context,
    max_tokens=1024,
    temperature=0.7
)
```

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Primary: Kimi (uses `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`)
- ‚úÖ Fallback: OpenRouter (uses `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) if Kimi rate-limited
- ‚úÖ Automatic switching (no manual intervention)
- ‚úÖ Rate limit handling (exponential backoff)
- ‚úÖ Statistics tracking (calls, tokens, costs)

### Search Results Storage
```python
if "search_results" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.search_results = None

# When user searches:
if search_term and articles_json:
    st.session_state.search_results = search_articles(...)
```

**Why This Works**:
- Session state persists across page refreshes
- Search results stored and displayed immediately
- No API calls needed (pure local search)
- Fast and responsive

### Chat Response Display
```python
# Store response
st.session_state.chat_response = response

# Display in main area
if st.session_state.chat_response:
    st.subheader("üí¨ Chat Response")
    st.markdown(f"<div class='chat-response-box'>{response}</div>")
```
