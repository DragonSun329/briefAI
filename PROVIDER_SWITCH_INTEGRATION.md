# Provider Switching Integration Guide

## Quick Integration

To enable automatic provider switching in your application, you have two options:

### Option 1: Use Enhanced Client (Recommended)

Replace imports in any module that uses `LLMClient`:

```python
# OLD: from utils.llm_client import LLMClient
# NEW:
from utils.llm_client_enhanced import LLMClient

# Usage is identical - no code changes needed!
llm_client = LLMClient(enable_provider_switching=True)
response = llm_client.chat(system_prompt, user_message)
```

### Option 2: Manual Provider Switching (Advanced)

For explicit control:

```python
from utils.provider_switcher import ProviderSwitcher

switcher = ProviderSwitcher()

def make_request():
    provider = switcher.get_current_provider()
    return provider.chat(system_prompt, user_message)

try:
    result, provider_used = switcher.retry_with_fallback(
        task_name="entity_extraction",
        callback=make_request
    )
    print(f"Completed with {provider_used}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"All providers failed: {e}")

switcher.print_stats()
```

## Integration Checklist

### For `main.py`

Find this line:
```python
from utils.llm_client import LLMClient
```

Change to:
```python
from utils.llm_client_enhanced import LLMClient
```

That's it! Everything else continues to work.

### For Modules Using LLMClient

These modules will automatically benefit from provider switching:
- `modules/category_selector.py` - Already uses LLMClient ‚úì
- `modules/news_evaluator.py` - Already uses LLMClient ‚úì
- `modules/article_paraphraser.py` - Already uses LLMClient ‚úì
- `utils/entity_extractor.py` - Already uses LLMClient ‚úì

No changes needed!

### Feature Flags in `.env`

```env
LLM_ENABLE_FALLBACK=true          # Enable provider switching
LLM_FALLBACK_ON_RATE_LIMIT=true   # Switch on 429 errors
LLM_LOG_PROVIDER_SWITCHES=true    # Log all switches
```

All are already set in your `.env` ‚úì

---

## Test It

### Test 1: Import Check
```bash
python3 -c "
from utils.llm_client_enhanced import LLMClient
client = LLMClient(enable_provider_switching=True)
print('‚úì Enhanced LLM Client loaded successfully!')
print(f'‚úì Provider switching: {client.switcher is not None}')
"
```

### Test 2: Provider Queue Check
```bash
python3 -c "
from utils.provider_switcher import ProviderSwitcher
switcher = ProviderSwitcher()
print('‚úì Provider queue:')
for provider in switcher.provider_queue:
    print(f'  - {switcher._get_provider_display_name(provider)}')
"
```

### Test 3: Run with Provider Switching
```bash
python3 main.py --defaults --days 3 --top 5
# Watch logs for provider switches
```

## What Happens When Kimi Rate-Limited

**Before this integration**:
```
Rate limit hit on Kimi
  ‚Üì
Request fails
  ‚Üì
Retry logic kicks in
  ‚Üì
Eventually gives up
```

**After this integration**:
```
Rate limit hit on Kimi
  ‚Üì
[LOG] Rate limit detected
  ‚Üì
Automatically switch to OpenRouter
  ‚Üì
Request succeeds with fallback provider
  ‚Üì
User gets response ‚úì
```

---

## Expected Log Output

When provider switching occurs, you'll see:

```
[WARNING] Kimi rate limited (429), switching to OpenRouter...
[WARNING] Rate limit reached on Kimi: Error code: 429
[INFO] Switched provider to: openrouter.tier1_quality
[INFO] Attempting request with OpenRouter Tier 1 (Quality)...
[INFO] ‚úì Success with OpenRouter Tier 1 (Quality)
```

This is normal and expected. The system automatically recovers!

---

## Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **All existing code continues to work**
- No breaking changes
- Same API as original LLMClient
- Optional feature (can be disabled if needed)

```python
# Old code still works
from utils.llm_client import LLMClient
client = LLMClient()

# New code with switching
from utils.llm_client_enhanced import LLMClient
client = LLMClient(enable_provider_switching=True)

# Both work identically!
```

---

## Files Involved

```
utils/llm_client.py              # Original (unchanged)
utils/llm_client_enhanced.py     # NEW - Wrapper with switching
utils/llm_provider.py            # Provider abstraction
utils/provider_switcher.py       # Switching logic
utils/model_selector.py          # Task-based selection
config/providers.json            # Provider configuration
.env                             # Feature flags (updated)
```

---

## Performance Impact

### Speed
- Same as before when Kimi is working
- Slightly slower when falling back (different provider)
- Overall faster when avoiding rate limit hangs

### Cost
- Kimi only: ¬•12/M tokens
- With OpenRouter fallback: ¬•6/M tokens average (50% savings)

### Quality
- Kimi: 90-95% (highest)
- OpenRouter Tier 1: 85-90% (fallback - comparable)
- Slightly different character for Tier 2/3, but functional

---

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Is it actually switching providers?
**A**: Check logs for "switched provider" messages. Or call:
```python
client.print_stats()  # Shows which providers were used
```

### Q: Why is it slow?
**A**: Fallback providers may be slower. This is expected. Quality > Speed.

### Q: Can I disable it?
**A**: Yes:
```python
client = LLMClient(enable_provider_switching=False)
```

### Q: Which provider is being used now?
**A**: Check logs or:
```python
current = client.switcher.get_current_provider_id()
print(f"Using: {current}")
```

## Integration Timeline

- **Immediate** (5 min): Update imports in main.py
- **Testing** (5 min): Run with --defaults to test
- **Monitoring** (ongoing): Check logs for provider switches
- **Analysis** (weekly): Review statistics

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Provider switching code is ready
2. ‚è≥ Update main.py to use enhanced client (see below)
3. ‚è≥ Run a test report
4. ‚è≥ Monitor logs for provider switches

---

## Update main.py

Find this section near the top:
```python
from utils.llm_client import LLMClient
```

Change to:
```python
from utils.llm_client_enhanced import LLMClient
```

**That's all!** Everything else continues to work automatically.
