# Phase 3 - Next Steps (Manual GitHub/Streamlit Setup)

## üéâ Great News!

All the code development is **100% complete** and ready to deploy! ‚úÖ

The system is production-ready with:
- ‚úÖ Streamlit web app (app.py)
- ‚úÖ GitHub auto-push integration (main.py)
- ‚úÖ Streamlit configuration
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation
- ‚úÖ Local Git repository with commits

**Nothing else needs to be coded or changed.**

All remaining steps are manual GitHub/Streamlit Cloud setup (no coding required).

## üìã Your Action Items (20-30 minutes total)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Account & Repository (5-10 min)

#### Option A: Using GitHub Web UI (Easiest)

1. **Create account** (if needed)
   - Go to https://github.com/signup
   - Sign up with email
   - Verify email
   - Choose free plan

2. **Create repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - **Repository name**: `briefAI`
   - **Description**: "AI Industry Weekly Briefing for CEO"
   - **Visibility**: Select **Private** ‚≠ê (important!)
   - **Initialize with**: Leave all unchecked
   - Click **Create repository**

3. **Note the repository URL**
   - It will show you: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/briefAI.git`
   - Save this for the next step

---

### Step 2: Push Code from Mac to GitHub (5-10 min)

Run these commands in Terminal on your Mac:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/dragonsun/briefAI

# Add GitHub as remote
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/briefAI.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push all code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Enumerating objects: 150, done.
Counting objects: 100% (150/150), done.
...
To https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/briefAI.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

**If you get a credential prompt:**
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: **Use a Personal Access Token** (not your password!)

**To create a Personal Access Token:**
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Check scope: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
3. Set expiration: 90 days
4. Create token
5. Copy and paste it when prompted for password

**Verify push succeeded:**
```bash
# Check local git
git log --oneline
# Should show recent commits

# Check on GitHub
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/briefAI
# Should show all files
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (5-10 min)

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud**
   - https://streamlit.io/cloud

2. **Sign in with GitHub**
   - Click "Sign in"
   - Choose "Continue with GitHub"
   - Authorize Streamlit to access your GitHub repos

3. **Create New App**
   - Click "New app"
   - Repository: `YOUR_USERNAME/briefAI`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Main file path: `app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

4. **Wait for deployment**
   - Usually takes 30-60 seconds
   - You'll see a progress bar
   - Once done, you get a URL like:
     ```
     https://dragonsun-briefai-abc123.streamlit.app
     ```

5. **Save the URL**
   - This is your briefing app URL
   - Bookmark it!
   - You'll share this with CEO

---

### Step 4: Add API Key to Streamlit Secrets (2-3 min)

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Never put API keys in code or GitHub!

1. **Open your Streamlit app settings**
   - Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
   - Find your `briefAI` app
   - Click the three dots (‚ãÆ) menu in top right
   - Select **Settings**

2. **Go to Secrets**
   - In the left sidebar, click **Secrets**

3. **Paste your API key**
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```
   - Replace `sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual API key
   - Make sure you include the quotes
   - No extra spaces or brackets

4. **Save and restart**
   - Click "Save"
   - App will restart in 10-30 seconds
   - Once restarted, the API key is loaded from secrets

---

### Step 5: Test the App (5 min)

1. **Visit your Streamlit app**
   - Go to the URL from Step 3
   - Should see the briefing app load

2. **Test the interface**
   - Check that the header loads
   - Look for report metrics
   - Try searching for a company (e.g., "OpenAI")
   - Check that results appear
   - Click an article to expand

3. **Troubleshoot if needed**
   - See "Common Issues" section below

---

### Step 6: Share with CEO (1-2 min)

Once tested, send CEO the URL:

**Example message:**
```
Hi [CEO Name],

Your weekly AI briefing is now live!

Access it here:
https://dragonsun-briefai-abc123.streamlit.app

You can:
- üì∞ Read the latest briefing (updates every Friday at 11 AM)
- üîç Search by company, model, or topic
- üì• Download the report as markdown

Just bookmark the link and visit every Friday!

Questions? See the CEO User Guide in the app.
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Fixes

### "Repository not found"
- Check that you created the repository on GitHub
- Verify the URL is correct
- Make sure it's marked as Private (if you want privacy)
- Try creating the repository again

### "Repository already exists"
- You already have a repository with that name
- Use a different name (e.g., `briefAI-v2`)
- Or delete the old one and recreate

### "Authentication failed" when pushing
- Generate a Personal Access Token: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
- Use token as password instead of GitHub password
- Make sure token has `repo` scope

### "App failed to initialize"
- Check Streamlit Cloud logs (click "Logs" tab)
- Verify `app.py` exists in the repository
- Check that `requirements.txt` is present
- Ensure no syntax errors in Python code

### "API Key not found" error in app
- Go to Streamlit Cloud Settings ‚Üí Secrets
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set
- Check for typos (must be exact)
- Check there are no extra spaces
- Secrets must be in format: `KEY = "value"`

### "No reports available yet"
- The briefing hasn't been generated yet
- This is normal before first Friday 11 AM generation
- Once you run `python main.py --defaults --finalize` on Mac, reports will appear
- Refresh the browser (F5 or Cmd+R)

### "My changes aren't showing"
- Streamlit may be caching
- Press R in the app or refresh browser
- If you pushed new code, wait 30-60 seconds for redeploy
- Check git push succeeded: `git status`
