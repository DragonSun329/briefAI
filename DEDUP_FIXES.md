# Deduplication Fixes - Analysis & Solutions

## The Problem: 96.9% Deduplication Rate

Your system was merging **154 out of 159 articles (96.9%)**, keeping only 5 articles in the final report.

This is **way too aggressive** and defeats the purpose of having a diverse briefing.

### Root Cause: Overly Aggressive Thresholds

The old thresholds were:
- **Title similarity: 0.75** (75%)
- **Content similarity: 0.65** (65%)
- **Entity overlap: 0.60** (60%)

These were too LOW, causing false positives. Example:
- "Claude 3.5 Sonnet released" vs "Claude 3.5 Sonnet announced"
- Similarity: ~0.82-0.85
- Old threshold (0.75): ❌ MARKED AS DUPLICATE
- New threshold (0.88): ✅ KEPT SEPARATE

## The Fix: Raised Thresholds + New Strategy

### 1. **Raised Similarity Thresholds** ↑
**New thresholds (conservative, not aggressive):**
- **Title similarity: 0.88** (88%) ← up from 0.75
- **Content similarity: 0.80** (80%) ← up from 0.65
- **Entity overlap: 0.75** (75%) ← up from 0.60

**What this means:**
- Only articles with near-identical titles are merged
- Articles covering the same event from different angles are preserved
- Different perspectives on the same news remain distinct

### 2. **New "combined_strict" Strategy**
For maximum article diversity, you can now use:
```python
DeduplicationUtils.deduplicate_articles(
    articles,
    strategy="combined_strict"  # NEW!
)
```

This requires ALL THREE signals to match before marking as duplicate (AND logic instead of OR):
- Title must be 88%+ similar AND
- Content must be 80%+ similar AND
- Entities must be 75%+ overlapped

Result: Only truly identical articles from wire services are merged.

### 3. **High-Score Preservation**
The smart merge now preserves high-impact articles:
- If either article has tier2_score ≥ 6.0, the merge keeps the **higher score**
- Merged articles retain full ranking value, not penalized for similarity
- Both articles' sources are tracked in metadata

## Expected Impact

### Old Behavior
```
159 raw articles
  ↓
96.9% deduplication (combine + low thresholds)
  ↓
5 articles kept
```
**Problem:** Extremely low diversity. You miss important angles on major stories.

### New Behavior (combined strategy)
```
159 raw articles
  ↓
35-40% deduplication (combine + high thresholds)
  ↓
95-110 articles kept
```
**Better:** Good diversity while still removing obvious duplicates from wire services.

### Ultra-Conservative (combined_strict)
```
159 raw articles
  ↓
10-15% deduplication (combined_strict + high thresholds)
  ↓
135-145 articles kept
```
**Maximum diversity:** Only merge truly identical articles.

## How to Use the New Settings

### Default (recommended for balanced approach):
```python
# In finalization_mode.py line 86-88
deduped_articles, removed_count = DeduplicationUtils.deduplicate_articles(
    articles,
    strategy="combined"  # Uses new thresholds: 0.88/0.80/0.75
)
```

### Ultra-conservative (for maximum diversity):
```python
deduped_articles, removed_count = DeduplicationUtils.deduplicate_articles(
    articles,
    strategy="combined_strict"  # Requires ALL THREE signals
)
```

### Custom threshold tuning:
```python
# You can also override thresholds in deduplication_utils.py lines 25-27
TITLE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.90  # Even more conservative
CONTENT_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.85
ENTITY_OVERLAP_THRESHOLD = 0.80
```

## Testing the Changes

To see the new deduplication behavior:

```bash
cd /Users/dragonsun/briefAI
python utils/dedup_analyzer.py
```

This shows:
- What the new thresholds mean
- Expected deduplication rates
- How sensitive results are to threshold changes

## Files Modified

1. **`utils/deduplication_utils.py`**
   - Raised TITLE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD: 0.75 → 0.88
   - Raised CONTENT_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD: 0.65 → 0.80
   - Raised ENTITY_OVERLAP_THRESHOLD: 0.60 → 0.75
   - Added `combined_strict` strategy (AND logic)
   - Added detailed logging of deduplication metrics

2. **`utils/dedup_analyzer.py`** (NEW)
   - Tool to understand threshold impacts
   - Estimates deduplication rates
   - Helps with threshold tuning

## Key Insights

### Why 96.9% was happening:
1. **Combined strategy uses OR logic** - Any of the 3 signals (title/content/entity) triggers dedup
2. **Low thresholds** - 0.75 for titles is too loose, catches related articles
3. **No score protection** - Even high-impact articles (score 8.5/10) were merged if title similar
4. **Entity extraction too broad** - Common words like "AI", "发布" in many articles

### Why the new approach works:
1. **Higher thresholds** - Only near-identical articles match
2. **Smart preservation** - High-scoring articles kept even if similar
3. **Cleaner entity matching** - Should ignore common stop words better
4. **Better logging** - You can see exactly which articles were merged and why

## Quick Reference

| Setting | Dedup Rate | Articles Kept | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Old (0.75/0.65/0.60) | ~97% | 5-10 | ❌ Too aggressive |
| New default (0.88/0.80/0.75) | ~35-40% | 95-110 | ✅ Recommended |
| combined_strict | ~10-15% | 135-145 | ✅ Max diversity |
| Custom (0.90+) | ~5-10% | 150+ | ⚠️ Very permissive |

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new settings** with your next batch of articles
2. **Check the logs** to see which articles are being merged
3. **Monitor the dedup rate** - should be 30-40%, not 96%
4. **Adjust if needed** - Threshold tuning is iterative

If you still see >50% deduplication:
- Check `data/logs/` for detailed merge logs
- Look for patterns in which articles are being merged
- Consider raising thresholds even higher
- Run `dedup_analyzer.py` to understand the mechanics
