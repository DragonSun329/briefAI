      "content": "It doesn't seem like the connection between AI and Moderna and Merck's breakthrough with its skin cancer vaccine, Intismeran, has been made. Moderna stock (MRNA) has gone up 83% year to date on the news that the vaccine is highly effective and durable.  The mainstream press know Moderna and mRNA from Covid, so they are reporting that part. What they are not exploring is the astounding fact that Intismeran is tailored to the individual. This is like a compression of the discovery of a Covid vaccine for each individual cancer patient.  In order to make the vaccine work, Moderna has to sequence that unique tumor in that one person, then run it through a complex computation to find the best candidate for fighting that specific mutation. This is only possible with accelerated computing and bioinformatics, i.e. AI.  This is a revolution in biotech. AI has cured cancer. And it's hiding in plain sight.    submitted by    /u/rhet0ric   [link] [comments]",

      "content": "This image is worth keeping in mind, because I see a lot of posts here (often from people newer to the sub) that suggest a misunderstanding of what the singularity or an intelligence explosion actually means. For most of history, progress looks flat. Thousands of years of tiny, incremental improvements. Then it starts to curve… slowly. Agriculture, industry, electricity, computing. Still feels manageable, still feels “human-paced.” That’s the long, boring bit on the left. The key thing people miss is that exponential growth doesn’t feel exponential while you’re in it. It feels underwhelming right up until it doesn’t. For a long time, each step forward looks like “meh, slightly better than last year.” Then suddenly the curve goes vertical, not because something magical happened at that moment, but because all the compounding finally stacks. The singularity isn’t “AI suddenly becomes a god overnight.” It’s the point where progress becomes so steep and self-reinforcing that human intuition, institutions, and timelines stop being useful tools for prediction. The jump looks absurd only in hindsight. So when people say “this doesn’t feel that fast” or “we’ve been overhyped before,” that’s exactly what you’d expect if you’re standing near the little stick figure on the graph, right before the wall. If you’re waiting for it to feel dramatic before taking the idea seriously, you’ve misunderstood the shape of the curve.    submitted by    /u/Heinrick_Veston   [link] [comments]",

      "content": "DeepMind has published AlphaGenome today in Nature, a sequence model designed to predict functional and regulatory effects across long stretches of DNA, including non-coding regions. Key points: • Processes up to ~1 million DNA base pairs in a single context window and Trained on human and mouse genomes. • Predicts thousands of genomic signals including gene expression, splicing, chromatin structure and regulatory interactions • Matches or outperforms prior models on 25 of 26 benchmark tasks. Particularly strong on non-coding DNA, where most disease-associated variants are found. Only ~2% of human DNA codes for proteins. The remaining ~98% regulates how, when and where genes are expressed. AlphaGenome is designed to model this regulatory layer at scale, which is critical for understanding rare disease, cancer mutations, and gene therapies. The model and weights are being made available to researchers and the AlphaGenome API is already seeing large-scale usage.

      "content": "Composer is a newly released autonomous browser agent built to carry out long-running, real-world knowledge work end to end. Based on published evaluations, Composer currently ranks #1 across major web-based agent benchmarks that measure planning, tool use, persistence and execution quality on real tasks. In head-to-head comparisons on real knowledge work, it outperforms tools such as ChatGPT Atlas, Claude for Chrome, Perplexity Comet, and Manus. These tests focus on multi-step research, sourcing, and extended browser workflows rather than short prompt responses. It's designed to operate autonomously for hours, handling complex workflows that require sustained memory, adaptive decision-making & thousands of model calls inside the browser. The project is led by an ex-MIT researcher and former Perplexity engineer, with a focus on execution-driven agents rather than chat-first assistants.
