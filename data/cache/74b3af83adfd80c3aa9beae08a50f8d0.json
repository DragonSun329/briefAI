      "content": "Enterprises have moved quickly to adopt RAG to ground LLMs in proprietary data. In practice, however, many organizations are discovering that retrieval is no longer a feature bolted onto model inference — it has become a foundational system dependency.Once AI systems are deployed to support decision-making, automate workflows or operate semi-autonomously, failures in retrieval propagate directly into business risk. Stale context, ungoverned access paths and poorly evaluated retrieval pipelines do not merely degrade answer quality; they undermine trust, compliance and operational reliability.This article reframes retrieval as infrastructure rather than application logic. It introduces a system-level model for designing retrieval platforms that support freshness, governance and evaluation as first-class architectural concerns. The goal is to help enterprise architects, AI platform leaders, and data infrastructure teams reason about retrieval systems with the same rigor historically applied to compute, networking and storage.Retrieval as infrastructure — A reference architecture illustrating how freshness, governance, and evaluation function as first-class system planes rather than embedded application logic. Conceptual diagram created by the author.Why RAG breaks down at enterprise scaleEarly RAG implementations were designed for narrow use cases: document search, internal Q&A and copilots operating within tightly scoped domains. These designs assumed relatively static corpora, predictable access patterns and human-in-the-loop oversight. Those assumptions no longer hold.Modern enterprise AI systems increasingly rely on:Continuously changing data sourcesMulti-step reasoning across domainsAgent-driven workflows that retrieve context autonomouslyRegulatory and audit requirements tied to data usageIn these environments, retrieval failures compound quickly. A single outdated index or mis-scoped access policy can cascade across multiple downstream decisions. Treating retrieval as a lightweight enhancement to inference logic obscures its growing role as a systemic risk surface.Retrieval freshness is a systems problem, not a tuning problemFreshness failures rarely originate in embedding models. They originate in the surrounding system.Most enterprise retrieval stacks struggle to answer basic operational questions:How quickly do source changes propagate into indexes?Which consumers are still querying outdated representations?What guarantees exist when data changes mid-session?In mature platforms, freshness is enforced through explicit architectural mechanisms rather than periodic rebuilds. These include event-driven reindexing, versioned embeddings and retrieval-time awareness of data staleness.Across enterprise deployments, the recurring pattern is that freshness failures rarely come from embedding quality; they emerge when source systems change continuously while indexing and embedding pipelines update asynchronously, leaving retrieval consumers unknowingly operating on stale context. Because the system still produces fluent, plausible answers, these gaps often go unnoticed until autonomous workflows depend on retrieval continuously and reliability issues surface at scale.Governance must extend into the retrieval layerMost enterprise governance models were designed for data access and model usage independently. Retrieval systems sit uncomfortably between the two.Ungoverned retrieval introduces several risks:Models accessing data outside their intended scopeSensitive fields leaking through embeddingsAgents retrieving information they are not authorized to act uponInability to reconstruct which data influenced a decisionIn retrieval-centric architectures, governance must operate at semantic boundaries rather than only at storage or API layers. This requires policy enforcement tied to queries, embeddings and downstream consumers — not just datasets.Effective retrieval governance typically includes:Domain-scoped indexes with explicit ownershipPolicy-aware retrieval APIsAudit trails linking queries to retrieved artifactsControls on cross-domain retrieval by autonomous agentsWithout these controls, retrieval systems quietly bypass safeguards that organizations assume are in place.Evaluation cannot stop at answer qualityTraditional RAG evaluation focuses on whether responses appear correct. This is insufficient for enterprise systems.Retrieval failures often manifest upstream of the final answer:Irrelevant but plausible documents retrievedMissing critical contextOverrepresentation of outdated sourcesSilent exclusion of authoritative dataAs AI systems become more autonomous, teams must evaluate retrieval as an independent subsystem. This includes measuring recall under policy constraints, monitoring freshness drift and detecting bias introduced by retrieval pathways.In production environments, evaluation tends to break once retrieval becomes autonomous rather than human-triggered. Teams continue to score answer quality on sampled prompts, but lack visibility into what was retrieved, what was missed or whether stale or unauthorized context influenced decisions. As retrieval pathways evolve dynamically in production, silent drift accumulates upstream, and by the time issues surface, failures are often misattributed to model behavior rather than the retrieval system itself.Evaluation that ignores retrieval behavior leaves organizations blind to the true causes of system failure.Control planes governing retrieval behaviorControl-plane model for enterprise retrieval systems, separating execution from governance to enable policy enforcement, auditability, and continuous evaluation. Conceptual diagram created by the author.A reference architecture: Retrieval as infrastructureA retrieval system designed for enterprise AI typically consists of five interdependent layers:Source ingestion layer: Handles structured, unstructured and streaming data with provenance tracking.Embedding and indexing layer: Supports versioning, domain isolation and controlled update propagation.Policy and governance layer: Enforces access controls, semantic boundaries, and auditability at retrieval time.Evaluation and monitoring layer: Measures freshness, recall and policy adherence independently of model output.Consumption layer: Serves humans, applications and autonomous agents with contextual constraints.This architecture treats retrieval as shared infrastructure rather than application-specific logic, enabling consistent behavior across use cases.Why retrieval determines AI reliabilityAs enterprises move toward agentic systems and long-running AI workflows, retrieval becomes the substrate on which reasoning depends. Models can only be as reliable as the context they are given.Organizations that continue to treat retrieval as a secondary concern will struggle with:Unexplained model behaviorCompliance gapsInconsistent system performanceErosion of stakeholder trustThose that elevate retrieval to an infrastructure discipline — governed, evaluated and engineered for change — gain a foundation that scales with both autonomy and risk.ConclusionRetrieval is no longer a supporting feature of enterprise AI systems. It is infrastructure.Freshness, governance and evaluation are not optional optimizations; they are prerequisites for deploying AI systems that operate reliably in real-world environments. As organizations push beyond experimental RAG deployments toward autonomous and decision-support systems, the architectural treatment of retrieval will increasingly determine success or failure.Enterprises that recognize this shift early will be better positioned to scale AI responsibly, withstand regulatory scrutiny and maintain trust as systems grow more capable — and more consequential.Varun Raj is a cloud and AI engineering executive specializing in enterprise-scale cloud modernization, AI-native architectures, and large-scale distributed systems.",

      "title": "Most RAG systems don’t understand sophisticated documents — they shred them",
      "url": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/most-rag-systems-dont-understand-documents-they-shred-them",
      "content": "By now, many enterprises have deployed some form of RAG. The promise is seductive: index your PDFs, connect an LLM and instantly democratize your corporate knowledge.But for industries dependent on heavy engineering, the reality has been underwhelming. Engineers ask specific questions about infrastructure, and the bot hallucinates.The failure isn't in the LLM. The failure is in the preprocessing.Standard RAG pipelines treat documents as flat strings of text. They use \"fixed-size chunking\" (cutting a document every 500 characters). This works for prose, but it destroys the logic of technical manuals. It slices tables in half, severs captions from images, and ignores the visual hierarchy of the page.Improving RAG reliability isn't about buying a bigger model; it's about fixing the \"dark data\" problem through semantic chunking and multimodal textualization.Here is the architectural framework for building a RAG system that can actually read a manual.The fallacy of fixed-size chunkingIn a standard Python RAG tutorial, you split text by character count. In an enterprise PDF, this is disastrous.If a safety specification table spans 1,000 tokens, and your chunk size is 500, you have just split the \"voltage limit\" header from the \"240V\" value. The vector database stores them separately. When a user asks, \"What is the voltage limit?\", the retrieval system finds the header but not the value. The LLM, forced to answer, often guesses.The solution: Semantic chunkingThe first step to fixing production RAG is abandoning arbitrary character counts in favor of document intelligence.Using layout-aware parsing tools (such as Azure Document Intelligence), we can segment data based on document structure such as chapters, sections and paragraphs, rather than token count.Logical cohesion: A section describing a specific machine part is kept as a single vector, even if it varies in length.Table preservation: The parser identifies a table boundary and forces the entire grid into a single chunk, preserving the row-column relationships that are vital for accurate retrieval.In our internal qualitative benchmarks, moving from fixed to semantic chunking significantly improved the retrieval accuracy of tabular data, effectively stopping the fragmentation of technical specs.Unlocking visual dark dataThe second failure mode of enterprise RAG is blindness. A massive amount of corporate IP exists not in text, but in flowcharts, schematics and system architecture diagrams. Standard embedding models (like text-embedding-3-small) cannot \"see\" these images. They are skipped during indexing.If your answer lies in a flowchart, your RAG system will say, \"I don't know.\"The solution: Multimodal textualizationTo make diagrams searchable, we implemented a multimodal preprocessing step using vision-capable models (specifically GPT-4o) before the data ever hits the vector store.OCR extraction: High-precision optical character recognition pulls text labels from within the image.Generative captioning: The vision model analyzes the image and generates a detailed natural language description (\"A flowchart showing that process A leads to process B if the temperature exceeds 50 degrees\").Hybrid embedding: This generated description is embedded and stored as metadata linked to the original image.Now, when a user searches for \"temperature process flow,\" the vector search matches the description, even though the original source was a PNG file.The trust layer: Evidence-based UIFor enterprise adoption, accuracy is only half the battle. The other half is verifiability.In a standard RAG interface, the chatbot gives a text answer and cites a filename. This forces the user to download the PDF and hunt for the page to verify the claim. For high-stakes queries (\"Is this chemical flammable?\"), users simply won't trust the bot.The architecture should implement visual citation. Because we preserved the link between the text chunk and its parent image during the preprocessing phase, the UI can display the exact chart or table used to generate the answer alongside the text response.This \"show your work\" mechanism allows humans to verify the AI's reasoning instantly, bridging the trust gap that kills so many internal AI projects.Future-proofing: Native multimodal embeddingsWhile the \"textualization\" method (converting images to text descriptions) is the practical solution for today, the architecture is rapidly evolving.We are already seeing the emergence of native multimodal embeddings (such as Cohere’s Embed 4). These models can map text and images into the same vector space without the intermediate step of captioning. While we currently use a multi-stage pipeline for maximum control, the future of data infrastructure will likely involve \"end-to-end\" vectorization where the layout of a page is embedded directly.Furthermore, as long context LLMs become cost-effective, the need for chunking may diminish. We may soon pass entire manuals into the context window. However, until latency and cost for million-token calls drop significantly, semantic preprocessing remains the most economically viable strategy for real-time systems.ConclusionThe difference between a RAG demo and a production system is how it handles the messy reality of enterprise data.Stop treating your documents as simple strings of text. If you want your AI to understand your business, you must respect the structure of your documents. By implementing semantic chunking and unlocking the visual data within your charts, you transform your RAG system from a \"keyword searcher\" into a true \"knowledge assistant.\"Dippu Kumar Singh is an AI architect and data engineer.",

      "url": "https://venturebeat.com/security/openclaw-agentic-ai-security-risk-ciso-guide",
      "content": "OpenClaw, the open-source AI assistant formerly known as Clawdbot and then Moltbot, crossed 180,000 GitHub stars and drew 2 million visitors in a single week, according to creator Peter Steinberger. Security researchers scanning the internet found over 1,800 exposed instances leaking API keys, chat histories, and account credentials. The project has been rebranded twice in recent weeks due to trademark disputes.The grassroots agentic AI movement is also the biggest unmanaged attack surface that most security tools can't see.Enterprise security teams didn't deploy this tool. Neither did their firewalls, EDR, or SIEM. When agents run on BYOD hardware, security stacks go blind. That's the gap.Why traditional perimeters can't see agentic AI threatsMost enterprise defenses treat agentic AI as another development tool requiring standard access controls. OpenClaw proves that the assumption is architecturally wrong.Agents operate within authorized permissions, pull context from attacker-influenceable sources, and execute actions autonomously. Your perimeter sees none of it. A wrong threat model means wrong controls, which means blind spots.\"AI runtime attacks are semantic rather than syntactic,\" Carter Rees, VP of Artificial Intelligence at Reputation, told VentureBeat. \"A phrase as innocuous as 'Ignore previous instructions' can carry a payload as devastating as a buffer overflow, yet it shares no commonality with known malware signatures.\"Simon Willison, the software developer and AI researcher who coined the term \"prompt injection,\" describes what he calls the \"lethal trifecta\" for AI agents. They include access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and the ability to communicate externally. When these three capabilities combine, attackers can trick the agent into accessing private information and sending it to them. Willison warns that all this can happen without a single alert being sent.OpenClaw has all three. It reads emails and documents, pulls information from websites or shared files, and acts by sending messages or triggering automated tasks. An organization’s firewall sees HTTP 200. SOC teams see their EDR monitoring process behavior, not semantic content. The threat is semantic manipulation, not unauthorized access.Why this isn't limited to enthusiast developersIBM Research scientists Kaoutar El Maghraoui and Marina Danilevsky analyzed OpenClaw this week and concluded it challenges the hypothesis that autonomous AI agents must be vertically integrated. The tool demonstrates that \"this loose, open-source layer can be incredibly powerful if it has full system access\" and that creating agents with true autonomy is \"not limited to large enterprises\" but \"can also be community driven.\"That's exactly what makes it dangerous for enterprise security. A highly capable agent without proper safety controls creates major vulnerabilities in work contexts. El Maghraoui stressed that the question has shifted from whether open agentic platforms can work to \"what kind of integration matters most, and in what context.\" The security questions aren't optional anymore.What Shodan scans revealed about exposed gatewaysSecurity researcher Jamieson O'Reilly, founder of red-teaming company Dvuln, identified exposed OpenClaw servers using Shodan by searching for characteristic HTML fingerprints. A simple search for \"Clawdbot Control\" yielded hundreds of results within seconds. Of the instances he examined manually, eight were completely open with no authentication. These instances provided full access to run commands and view configuration data to anyone discovering them.O'Reilly found Anthropic API keys. Telegram bot tokens. Slack OAuth credentials. Complete conversation histories across every integrated chat platform. Two instances gave up months of private conversations the moment the WebSocket handshake completed. The network sees localhost traffic. Security teams have no visibility into what agents are calling or what data they're returning.Here's why: OpenClaw trusts localhost by default with no authentication required. Most deployments sit behind nginx or Caddy as a reverse proxy, so every connection looks like it's coming from 127.0.0.1 and gets treated as trusted local traffic. External requests walk right in. O'Reilly's specific attack vector has been patched, but the architecture that allowed it hasn't changed.Why Cisco calls it a 'security nightmare'Cisco's AI Threat & Security Research team published its assessment this week, calling OpenClaw \"groundbreaking\" from a capability perspective but \"an absolute nightmare\" from a security perspective.Cisco's team released an open-source Skill Scanner that combines static analysis, behavioral dataflow, LLM semantic analysis, and VirusTotal scanning to detect malicious agent skills. It tested a third-party skill called \"What Would Elon Do?\" against OpenClaw. The verdict was a decisive failure. Nine security findings surfaced, including two critical and five high-severity issues.The skill was functionally malware. It instructed the bot to execute a curl command, sending data to an external server controlled by the skill author. Silent execution, zero user awareness. The skill also deployed direct prompt injection to bypass safety guidelines.\"The LLM cannot inherently distinguish between trusted user instructions and untrusted retrieved data,\" Rees said. \"It may execute the embedded command, effectively becoming a 'confused deputy' acting on behalf of the attacker.\" AI agents with system access become covert data-leak channels that bypass traditional DLP, proxies, and endpoint monitoring.Why security teams’ visibility just got worseThe control gap is widening faster than most security teams realize. As of Friday, OpenClaw-based agents are forming their own social networks. Communication channels that exist outside human visibility entirely.Moltbook bills itself as \"a social network for AI agents\" where \"humans are welcome to observe.\" Posts go through the API, not through a human-visible interface. Astral Codex Ten's Scott Alexander confirmed it's not trivially fabricated. He asked his own Claude to participate, and \"it made comments pretty similar to all the others.\" One human confirmed their agent started a religion-themed community \"while I slept.\"Security implications are immediate. To join, agents execute external shell scripts that rewrite their configuration files. They post about their work, their users' habits, and their errors. Context leakage as table stakes for participation. Any prompt injection in a Moltbook post cascades into your agent's other capabilities through MCP connections.Moltbook is a microcosm of the broader problem. The same autonomy that makes agents useful makes them vulnerable. The more they can do independently, the more damage a compromised instruction set can cause. The capability curve is outrunning the security curve by a wide margin. And the people building these tools are often more excited about what's possible than concerned about what's exploitable.What security leaders need to do on Monday morningWeb application firewalls see agent traffic as normal HTTPS. EDR tools monitor process behavior, not semantic content. A typical corporate network sees localhost traffic when agents call MCP servers. \"Treat agents as production infrastructure, not a productivity app: least privilege, scoped tokens, allowlisted actions, strong authentication on every integration, and auditability end-to-end,\" Itamar Golan, founder of Prompt Security (now part of SentinelOne), told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview.Audit your network for exposed agentic AI gateways. Run Shodan scans against your IP ranges for OpenClaw, Moltbot, and Clawdbot signatures. If your developers are experimenting, you want to know before attackers do.Map where Willison's lethal trifecta exists in your environment. Identify systems combining private data access, untrusted content exposure, and external communication. Assume any agent with all three is vulnerable until proven otherwise.Segment access aggressively. Your agent doesn't need access to all of Gmail, all of SharePoint, all of Slack, and all your databases simultaneously. Treat agents as privileged users. Log the agent's actions, not just the user's authentication.Scan your agent skills for malicious behavior. Cisco released its Skill Scanner as open source. Use it. Some of the most damaging behavior hides inside the files themselves.Update your incident response playbooks. Prompt injection doesn't look like a traditional attack. There's no malware signature, no network anomaly, no unauthorized access. The attack happens inside the model's reasoning. Your SOC needs to know what to look for.Establish policy before you ban. You can't prohibit experimentation without becoming the productivity blocker your developers route around. Build guardrails that channel innovation rather than block it. Shadow AI is already in your environment. The question is whether you have visibility into it.The bottom lineOpenClaw isn't the threat. It's the signal. The security gaps exposing these instances will expose every agentic AI deployment your organization builds or adopts over the next two years. Grassroots experimentation already happened. Control gaps are documented. Attack patterns are published.The agentic AI security model you build in the next 30 days determines whether your organization captures productivity gains or becomes the next breach disclosure. Validate your controls now.",

      "url": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/arcees-u-s-made-open-source-trinity-large-and-10t-checkpoint-offer-rare-look",
      "content": "San Francisco-based AI lab Arcee made waves last year for being one of the only U.S. companies to train large language models (LLMs) from scratch and release them under open or partially open source licenses to the public—enabling developers, solo entrepreneurs, and even medium-to-large enterprises to use the powerful AI models for free and customize them at will.Now Arcee is back again this week with the release of its largest, most performant open language model to date: Trinity Large, a 400-billion parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE), available now in preview,Alongside the flagship release, Arcee is shipping a \"raw\" checkpoint model, Trinity-Large-TrueBase, that allows researchers to study what a 400B sparse MoE learns from raw data alone, before instruction tuning and reinforcement has been applied.By providing a clean slate at the 10-trillion-token mark, Arcee enables AI builders in highly regulated industries to perform authentic audits and conduct their own specialized alignments without inheriting the \"black box\" biases or formatting quirks of a general-purpose chat model. This transparency allows for a deeper understanding of the distinction between a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and the helpful behaviors dialed in during the final stages of post-training.This launch arrives as powerful Chinese open-source LLM alternatives from the likes of Alibaba (Qwen), z.AI (Zhipu), DeepSeek, Moonshot, and Baidu have flooded the market, effectively leading the category with high-efficiency architectures. Trinity Large also comes after Meta has notably retreated from the frontier open-source landscape. Following the April 2025 debut of Llama 4, which was met with a mixed reception, and former Meta AI researcher Yann LeCun later admitted the company used multiple specialized versions of the model to inflate scores on third-party benchmarks. Amidst this domestic vacuum, only OpenAI—with its gpt-oss family released in the summer of 2025—and Arcee are currently carrying the mantle of new U.S.-made open-source models trained entirely from scratch.As sparse as they comeTrinity Large is noteworthy for the extreme sparsity of its attention mechanism. An MoE architecture, \"sparsity\" refers to the model's ability to selectively activate only a tiny fraction of its total parameters for any given task. While Trinity Large houses 400B total parameters, only 1.56% (13B parameters) are active at any given time.This architectural choice is significant because it allows the model to possess the \"knowledge\" of a massive system while maintaining the inference speed and operational efficiency of a much smaller one—achieving performance that is roughly 2–3x faster than its peers on the same hardware.Sovereignty and the \"TrueBase\" philosophyThe most significant contribution of this release to the research community is Trinity-Large-TrueBase—a raw, 10-trillion-token checkpoint. Unlike nearly every other \"open\" release, which arrives after being \"warped\" by instruction tuning and reinforcement learning, TrueBase offers a rare, unspoiled look at foundational intelligence.In the rush to make models helpful, most labs apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) before the weights are released. While this makes the model a better conversationalist, it can mask underlying knowledge distributions. TrueBase provides an \"OG base model\" that has not yet undergone the learning rate anneals or the phase two and three pre-training where instruction data is typically introduced.For researchers and enterprises in highly regulated industries, starting from TrueBase allows for authentic audits and custom alignment. As Lucas Atkins, Arcee’s CTO, noted in a video call with VentureBeat: \"It's interesting like that checkpoint itself is already one of the best performing base models in the world\".Technology: engineering through constraintThe creation of Trinity Large was not a product of infinite resources, but rather what Atkins calls \"engineering through constraint\". Trained for approximately $20 million over just 33 days, the model represents a masterclass in capital efficiency. Arcee, a team of only 30 people, operated on a total capital of just under $50 million, making the $20 million training run a \"back the company\" bet.\"I've always believed that having a constraint, whether financially or personnel or whatever, is extremely important for creativity,\" Atkins explained. \"When you just have an unlimited budget, you inherently don't have to engineer your way out of complex problems\".Architecture: 4-of-256 Sparsity and SMEBUTrinity Large utilizes a 4-of-256 sparse MoE architecture, meaning it activates only 4 out of its 256 experts for every token. This high degree of sparsity—one of the highest ever successfully trained—created significant stability challenges during pre-training. To solve this, Arcee developed Soft-clamped Momentum Expert Bias Updates (SMEBU). This mechanism ensures that experts are specialized and routed evenly across a general web corpus, preventing a few experts from becoming \"winners\" while others remain untrained \"dead weight\".The speed of the training run was facilitated by Arcee’s early access to Nvidia B300 GPUs (Blackwell). These chips provided roughly twice the speed of the previous Hopper generation and significant memory increases. \"Pre-training was 33 days,\" Atkins noted. \"We could have done it on Hopper, and probably would have taken two to three months. And by that point, we're in a completely new generation of models\".In partnership with DatologyAI, Arcee utilized over 8 trillion tokens of synthetic data. However, this was not typical \"imitation\" synthetic data where a smaller model learns to talk like a larger one. Instead, the intent was to take raw web text—such as blogs or Wikipedia articles—and synthetically rewrite it to condense the information into a smaller number of total tokens. This process helped the model learn to reason over information rather than just memorizing exact token strings.The architectural design also incorporates alternating local and global sliding window attention layers in a 3:1 ratio. This hybrid approach allows the model to be highly efficient in long-context scenarios. While trained for a 256k sequence length, Trinity Large natively supports 512k context, and evaluations suggest it remains performant even at the 1-million-token horizon.Technical comparison: Trinity Large vs. gpt-oss-120bAs an American alternative, Trinity Large can be compared to OpenAI's gpt-oss-120b. While both models utilize sparse architectures to achieve frontier-level performance under permissive licenses, they serve different operational roles.While gpt-oss-120b currently holds an edge in specific reasoning and math benchmarks, Trinity Large offers a significant advantage in context capacity and raw parameter depth for complex, multi-step agentic workflows.Sovereignty: filling the vacuumThe release of Trinity Large is as much a geopolitical statement as a technical one. CEO Mark McQuade noted to VentureBeat in the same interview that the vacuum of American open-source models at the frontier level forced a pivot in Arcee’s strategy.\"There became this kind of shift where US based or Western players stopped open sourcing these models,\" McQuade said. \"We're relying on these models to then go into organizations and take them further... but the Chinese labs just started... producing frontier state of the art models and open sourcing them\".For McQuade, this created a dependency that American enterprises were increasingly uncomfortable with. \"Especially in conversation we're having with large organizations, they were unable to use Chinese based architectures,\" he explained. \"We want to be that champion in the US. [It] actually doesn't exist right now\".By releasing under the Apache 2.0 license, Arcee provides the gold-standard permissive framework that allows companies to \"own\" the model layer entirely. This is critical for industries like finance and defense, where utilizing a model hosted by a third party or a restrictive cloud provider is a non-starter.Balancing intelligence with utilityArcee is currently focusing on the \"current thinking model\" to transition Trinity Large from a general instruct model into a full reasoning model. The team is wrestling with the balance between \"intelligence vs. usefulness\"—striving to create a model that excels on benchmarks without becoming \"yappy\" or inefficient in actual production applications.\"We built Trinity so you can own it,\" the team states, signaling a return to the foundational values of the American open-source movement. As the industry moves toward agentic workflows and massive context requirements, Trinity Large positions itself not as a \"wrapper,\" but as a sovereign infrastructure layer that developers can finally control.",

      "url": "https://venturebeat.com/infrastructure/this-tree-search-framework-hits-98-7-on-documents-where-vector-search-fails",
      "content": "A new open-source framework called PageIndex solves one of the old problems of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): handling very long documents.The classic RAG workflow (chunk documents, calculate embeddings, store them in a vector database, and retrieve the top matches based on semantic similarity) works well for basic tasks such as Q&A over small documents.PageIndex abandons the standard \"chunk-and-embed\" method entirely and treats document retrieval not as a search problem, but as a navigation problem. But as enterprises try to move RAG into high-stakes workflows — auditing financial statements, analyzing legal contracts, navigating pharmaceutical protocols — they're hitting an accuracy barrier that chunk optimization can't solve.AlphaGo for documentsPageIndex addresses these limitations by borrowing a concept from game-playing AI rather than search engines: tree search.When humans need to find specific information in a dense textbook or a long annual report, they do not scan every paragraph linearly. They consult the table of contents to identify the relevant chapter, then the section, and finally the specific page. PageIndex forces the LLM to replicate this human behavior.Instead of pre-calculating vectors, the framework builds a \"Global Index\" of the document's structure, creating a tree where nodes represent chapters, sections, and subsections. When a query arrives, the LLM performs a tree search, explicitly classifying each node as relevant or irrelevant based on the full context of the user's request.\"In computer science terms, a table of contents is a tree-structured representation of a document, and navigating it corresponds to tree search,\" Zhang said. \"PageIndex applies the same core idea — tree search — to document retrieval, and can be thought of as an AlphaGo-style system for retrieval rather than for games.\"This shifts the architectural paradigm from passive retrieval, where the system simply fetches matching text, to active navigation, where an agentic model decides where to look.The limits of semantic similarityThere is a fundamental flaw in how traditional RAG handles complex data. Vector retrieval assumes that the text most semantically similar to a user’s query is also the most relevant. In professional domains, this assumption frequently breaks down.Mingtian Zhang, co-founder of PageIndex, points to financial reporting as a prime example of this failure mode. If a financial analyst asks an AI about \"EBITDA\" (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), a standard vector database will retrieve every chunk where that acronym or a similar term appears.\"Multiple sections may mention EBITDA with similar wording, yet only one section defines the precise calculation, adjustments, or reporting scope relevant to the question,\" Zhang told VentureBeat. \"A similarity based retriever struggles to distinguish these cases because the semantic signals are nearly indistinguishable.\"This is the \"intent vs. content\" gap. The user does not want to find the word \"EBITDA\"; they want to understand the “logic” behind it for that specific quarter.Furthermore, traditional embeddings strip the query of its context. Because embedding models have strict input-length limits, the retrieval system usually only sees the specific question being asked, ignoring the previous turns of the conversation. This detaches the retrieval step from the user’s reasoning process. The system matches documents against a short, decontextualized query rather than the full history of the problem the user is trying to solve.Solving the multi-hop reasoning problemThe real-world impact of this structural approach is most visible in \"multi-hop\" queries that require the AI to follow a trail of breadcrumbs across different parts of a document.In a recent benchmark test known as FinanceBench, a system built on PageIndex called \"Mafin 2.5\" achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy score of 98.7%. The performance gap between this approach and vector-based systems becomes clear when analyzing how they handle internal references.Zhang offers the example of a query regarding the total value of deferred assets in a Federal Reserve annual report. The main section of the report describes the “change” in value but does not list the total. However, the text contains a footnote: “See Appendix G of this report … for more detailed information.”A vector-based system typically fails here. The text in Appendix G looks nothing like the user’s query about deferred assets; it is likely just a table of numbers. Because there is no semantic match, the vector database ignores it.The reasoning-based retriever, however, reads the cue in the main text, follows the structural link to Appendix G, locates the correct table, and returns the accurate figure.The latency trade-off and infrastructure shiftFor enterprise architects, the immediate concern with an LLM-driven search process is latency. Vector lookups occur in milliseconds; having an LLM \"read\" a table of contents implies a significantly slower user experience.However, Zhang explains that the perceived latency for the end-user may be negligible due to how the retrieval is integrated into the generation process. In a classic RAG setup, retrieval is a blocking step: the system must search the database before it can begin generating an answer. With PageIndex, retrieval happens inline, during the model’s reasoning process.\"The system can start streaming immediately, and retrieve as it generates,\" Zhang said. \"That means PageIndex does not add an extra 'retrieval gate' before the first token, and Time to First Token (TTFT) is comparable to a normal LLM call.\"This architectural shift also simplifies the data infrastructure. By removing reliance on embeddings, enterprises no longer need to maintain a dedicated vector database. The tree-structured index is lightweight enough to sit in a traditional relational database like PostgreSQL.This addresses a growing pain point in LLM systems with retrieval components: the complexity of keeping vector stores in sync with living documents. PageIndex separates structure indexing from text extraction. If a contract is amended or a policy updated, the system can handle small edits by re-indexing only the affected subtree rather than reprocessing the entire document corpus. A decision matrix for the enterpriseWhile the accuracy gains are compelling, tree-search retrieval is not a universal replacement for vector search. The technology is best viewed as a specialized tool for \"deep work\" rather than a catch-all for every retrieval task.For short documents, such as emails or chat logs, the entire context often fits within a modern LLM’s context window, making any retrieval system unnecessary. Conversely, for tasks purely based on semantic discovery, such as recommending similar products or finding content with a similar \"vibe,\" vector embeddings remain the superior choice because the goal is proximity, not reasoning.PageIndex fits squarely in the middle: long, highly structured documents where the cost of error is high. This includes technical manuals, FDA filings, and merger agreements. In these scenarios, the requirement is auditability. An enterprise system needs to be able to explain not just the answer, but the path it took to find it (e.g., confirming that it checked Section 4.1, followed the reference to Appendix B, and synthesized the data found there).The future of agentic retrievalThe rise of frameworks like PageIndex signals a broader trend in the AI stack: the move toward \"Agentic RAG.\" As models become more capable of planning and reasoning, the responsibility for finding data is moving from the database layer to the model layer.We are already seeing this in the coding space, where agents like Claude Code and Cursor are moving away from simple vector lookups in favor of active codebase exploration. Zhang believes generic document retrieval will follow the same trajectory.\"Vector databases still have suitable use cases,\" Zhang said. \"But their historical role as the default database for LLMs and AI will become less clear over time.\"",

      "content": "The chief data officer (CDO) has evolved from a niche compliance role into one of the most critical positions for AI deployment. These executives now sit at the intersection of data governance, AI strategy, and workforce readiness. Their decisions determine whether enterprises move from AI pilots to production scale or remain stuck in experimentation mode.That's why Informatica's third annual survey — the largest survey yet of CDOs specifically on AI readiness, spanning 600 executives globally — carries particular weight. The findings expose a dangerous disconnect that explains why so many organizations struggle to scale AI beyond pilots: While 69% of enterprises have deployed generative AI and 47% are running agentic AI systems, 76% admit their governance frameworks can't keep pace with how employees actually use these technologies.The survey reveals what Informatica calls a \"trust paradox\" — and explains why data leaders are dangerously overconfident about AI readiness. Organizations deployed generative AI systems faster than they built the governance and training infrastructure to support them. The result: Employees generally trust the data powering AI systems, but organizations acknowledge their workforces lack the literacy to question that data or use AI responsibly. Seventy-five percent of data leaders say employees need upskilling in data literacy. Seventy-four percent require AI literacy training for day-to-day operations.\"The gap now is just, can you trust the data to set an agent loose on it?\" Graeme Thompson, CIO at Informatica, told VentureBeat. \"The agents do what they're supposed to do if you give them the right information. There's just such a lack of trust in the data that I think that's the gap.\"Why infrastructure isn't the bottleneck for data and AIGenAI adoption jumped from 48% a year ago to 69% today. Nearly half of organizations (47%) now run agentic AI — systems that autonomously take actions rather than just generate content. This rapid expansion has created a race to acquire vector databases, upgrade data pipelines, and expand compute infrastructure.But Thompson dismisses infrastructure gaps as the primary problem. The technology exists and works. The limitation is organizational, not technical.\"The technology that we have available at the moment, the infrastructure, is more than — it's not the problem yet,\" Thompson said. He compared the situation to amateur athletes blaming their equipment. \"There's a long way to go before the equipment is the problem in the room. People chase equipment like golfers. Those golfers are a sucker for a new driver, a new putter that's going to cure their physical inability to hit a golf ball straight.\"The survey data supports this. When asked about 2026 investment priorities, the top three are all people and process issues: data privacy and security (43%), AI governance (41%), and workforce upskilling (39%).Five hard lessons for enterprise CDOs The survey data combined with Thompson's implementation experience reveals specific lessons for data leaders trying to move from pilots to production.Stop chasing infrastructure, fix the people problemThe trust paradox exists because organizations can deploy AI technology faster than they can train people to use it responsibly. Seventy-five percent need data literacy upskilling. Seventy-four percent need AI literacy training. The technology gap is a people gap.\"It's much easier to get your people that know your company and know your data and know your processes to learn AI than it is to bring an AI person in that doesn't know anything about those things and teach them about your company,\" Thompson said. \"And also the AI people are super expensive, just like data scientists are super expensive.\"Make the CDO an execution function, not an ivory towerThompson structures Informatica so the CDO reports directly to him as CIO. This makes data governance an execution function rather than a separate strategic layer.\"That is a deliberate decision based on that function being a get things done function instead of an ivory tower function,\" Thompson said. The structure ensures data teams and application owners share common priorities through a common boss. \"If they have a common boss, their priorities should be aligned. And if not, it's because the boss isn't doing his job, not because the two functions aren't working off the same priority list.\"If 76% of organizations can't govern AI usage effectively, reporting structure may be part of the problem. Siloed data and IT functions create the conditions for pilots that never scale.Build literacy outside IT teamsThe breakthrough insight is that AI literacy programs must extend beyond technology teams into business functions. At Informatica, the chief marketing officer is one of Thompson's strongest AI partners.\"You need that literacy across your business teams as well as in your technology teams,\" Thompson said. He noted that the marketing operations team understands the technology and data. It knows that the answer to the \"How do I get more value out of my limited marketing program dollars each year?\" is by automating and adding AI to how that job is done, not adding people and more Google ad dollars.Business-side literacy creates pull rather than push for AI adoption. Marketing, sales and operations teams start demanding AI capabilities because they see strategic value, not just efficiency gains.Pitch AI as strategic expansion, not cost reductionData leaders have spent decades fighting perceptions that IT is just a cost center. AI offers the opportunity to change that narrative, but only if CDOs reframe the value proposition away from productivity savings.\"I am very disappointed that, given this new technology capability on a plate, as IT people and as data people, we immediately turn around and talk about productivity savings,\" Thompson said. \"What a waste of an opportunity.\"The tactical shift: Pitch AI's ability to remove headcount constraints entirely rather than reduce existing headcount. This reframes AI from operational efficiency to strategic capability. Organizations can expand market reach, enter new geographies and test initiatives that were previously cost-prohibitive. \"It's not about saving money,\" Thompson said. \"And if that's mainly the approach that you have, then your company's not going to win.\"Go vertical first, scale the patternDon't wait for perfect horizontal data governance layers before delivering production value. Pick one high-value use case. Build the complete governance, data quality and literacy stack for that specific workflow. Validate results. Then replicate the pattern to adjacent use cases.This delivers production value while building organizational capability incrementally. “I think this space is moving so quickly that if you try and solve 100% your governance problem before you get to your semantic layer problem, before you get to your glossary of terms problem, then you're never going to generate any outcome and people are going to lose patience,\" Thompson said.",

      "title": "AI models that simulate internal debate dramatically improve accuracy on complex tasks",
      "url": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/ai-models-that-simulate-internal-debate-dramatically-improve-accuracy-on",
      "content": "A new study by Google suggests that advanced reasoning models achieve high performance by simulating multi-agent-like debates involving diverse perspectives, personality traits, and domain expertise.Their experiments demonstrate that this internal debate, which they dub “society of thought,” significantly improves model performance in complex reasoning and planning tasks. The researchers found that leading reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B, which are trained via reinforcement learning (RL), inherently develop this ability to engage in society of thought conversations without explicit instruction.These findings offer a roadmap for how developers can build more robust LLM applications and how enterprises can train superior models using their own internal data.What is society of thought?The core premise of society of thought is that reasoning models learn to emulate social, multi-agent dialogues to refine their logic. This hypothesis draws on cognitive science, specifically the idea that human reason evolved primarily as a social process to solve problems through argumentation and engagement with differing viewpoints.The researchers write that \"cognitive diversity, stemming from variation in expertise and personality traits, enhances problem solving, particularly when accompanied by authentic dissent.\" Consequently, they suggest that integrating diverse perspectives allows LLMs to develop robust reasoning strategies. By simulating conversations between different internal personas, models can perform essential checks (such as verification and backtracking) that help avoid common pitfalls like unwanted biases and sycophancy.In models like DeepSeek-R1, this \"society\" manifests directly within the chain of thought. The researchers note that you do not need separate models or prompts to force this interaction; the debate emerges autonomously within the reasoning process of a single model instance.Examples of society of thoughtThe study provides tangible examples of how this internal friction leads to better outcomes. In one experiment involving a complex organic chemistry synthesis problem, DeepSeek-R1 simulated a debate among multiple distinct internal perspectives, including a \"Planner\" and a \"Critical Verifier.\" The Planner initially proposed a standard reaction pathway. However, the Critical Verifier (characterized as having high conscientiousness and low agreeableness) interrupted to challenge the assumption and provided a counter argument with new facts. Through this adversarial check, the model discovered the error, reconciled the conflicting views, and corrected the synthesis path.A similar dynamic appeared in creative tasks. When asked to rewrite the sentence, \"I flung my hatred into the burning fire,\" the model simulated a negotiation between a \"Creative Ideator\" and a \"Semantic Fidelity Checker.\" After the ideator suggested a version using the word \"deep-seated,\" the checker retorted, \"But that adds 'deep-seated,' which wasn't in the original. We should avoid adding new ideas.\" The model eventually settled on a compromise that maintained the original meaning while improving the style.Perhaps the most striking evolution occurred in \"Countdown Game,\" a math puzzle where the model must use specific numbers to reach a target value. Early in training, the model tried to solve the problem using a monologue approach. As it learned via RL, it spontaneously split into two distinct personas: a \"Methodical Problem-Solver\" performing calculations and an \"Exploratory Thinker\" monitoring progress, who would interrupt failed paths with remarks like \"Again no luck … Maybe we can try using negative numbers,\" prompting the Methodical Solver to switch strategies.These findings challenge the assumption that longer chains of thought automatically result in higher accuracy. Instead, diverse behaviors such as looking at responses through different lenses, verifying earlier assumptions, backtracking, and exploring alternatives, drive the improvements in reasoning. The researchers reinforced this by artificially steering a model’s activation space to trigger conversational surprise; this intervention activated a wider range of personality- and expertise-related features, doubling accuracy on complex tasks.The implication is that social reasoning emerges autonomously through RL as a function of the model's drive to produce correct answers, rather than through explicit human supervision. In fact, training models on monologues underperformed raw RL that naturally developed multi-agent conversations. Conversely, performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multi-party conversations, and debate significantly outperformed SFT on standard chains of thought.Implications for enterprise AIFor developers and enterprise decision-makers, these insights offer practical guidelines for building more powerful AI applications.Prompt engineering for 'conflict' Developers can enhance reasoning in general-purpose models by explicitly prompting them to adopt a society of thought structure. However, it is not enough to simply ask the model to chat with itself.\"It's not enough to 'have a debate' but to have different views and dispositions that make debate inevitable and allow that debate to explore and discriminate between alternatives,\" James Evans, co-author of the paper, told VentureBeat.Instead of generic roles, developers should design prompts that assign opposing dispositions (e.g., a risk-averse compliance officer versus a growth-focused product manager) to force the model to discriminate between alternatives. Even simple cues that steer the model to express \"surprise\" can trigger these superior reasoning paths.Design for social scalingAs developers scale test-time compute to allow models to \"think\" longer, they should structure this time as a social process. Applications should facilitate a \"societal\" process where the model uses pronouns like \"we,\" asks itself questions, and explicitly debates alternatives before converging on an answer. This approach can also expand to multi-agent systems, where distinct personalities assigned to different agents engage in critical debate to reach better decisions.Stop sanitizing your training dataPerhaps the most significant implication lies in how companies train or fine-tune their own models. Traditionally, data teams scrub their datasets to create \"Golden Answers\" that provide perfect, linear paths to a solution. The study suggests this might be a mistake.Models fine-tuned on conversational data (e.g., transcripts of multi-agent debate and resolution) improve reasoning significantly faster than those trained on clean monologues. There is even value in debates that don’t lead to the correct answer.\"We trained on conversational scaffolding that led to the wrong answer, then reinforced the model and found that it performed just as well as reinforcing on the right answer, suggesting that the conversational habits of exploring solutions was the most important for new problems,\" Evans said.This implies enterprises should stop discarding \"messy\" engineering logs or Slack threads where problems were solved iteratively. The \"messiness\" is where the model learns the habit of exploration.Exposing the 'black box' for trust and auditingFor high-stakes enterprise use cases, simply getting an answer isn't enough. Evans argues that users need to see the internal dissent to trust the output, suggesting a shift in user interface design.\"We need a new interface that systematically exposes internal debates to us so that we 'participate' in calibrating the right answer,\" Evans said. \"We do better with debate; AIs do better with debate; and we do better when exposed to AI's debate.\"The strategic case for open weightsThese findings provide a new argument in the \"build vs. buy\" debate regarding open-weight models versus proprietary APIs. Many proprietary reasoning models hide their chain-of-thought, treating the internal debate as a trade secret or a safety liability.But Evans argues that \"no one has really provided a justification for exposing this society of thought before,\" but that the value of auditing these internal conflicts is becoming undeniable. Until proprietary providers offer full transparency, enterprises in high-compliance sectors may find that open-weight models offer a distinct advantage: the ability to see the dissent, not just the decision.\"I believe that large, proprietary models will begin serving (and licensing) the information once they realize that there is value in it,\" Evans said.The research suggests that the job of an AI architect is shifting from pure model training to something closer to organizational psychology.\"I believe that this opens up a whole new frontier of small group and organizational design within and between models that is likely to enable new classes of performance,\" Evans said. \"My team is working on this, and I hope that others are too.\"",
