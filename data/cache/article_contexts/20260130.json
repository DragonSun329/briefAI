      "full_content": "Hey HN, we're Haakam, Michael, and Adi. We're building AgentMail (https://agentmail.to), the email inbox API for agents. We’re not talking about AI for your email, this is email for your AI.Email is an optimal interface for long-running agents. It’s multithreaded and asynchronous with full support for rich text and files. It’s a universal protocol with identity and authentication built in. Moreover, a lot of workflow critical context already lives in email.We wanted to build email agents that you can forward your work to and get back a completed task. The agents could act entirely autonomously as you wouldn't need to delegate your identity. If they did get stuck they could just send you, or anyone else, an email.Using Gmail, we kept getting stuck on the limitations of their API. No way to create inboxes programmatically. Rate and sending limits. OAuth for every single inbox. Keyword search that doesn't understand context. Per-seat pricing that doesn't work for agents.So we built what we wished existed: an email provider for developers. APIs for creating inboxes and configuring domains. Email parsing and threading. Text extraction from attachments. Realtime webhooks and websockets. Semantic search across inboxes. Usage-based pricing that works for agents.Developers, startups, and enterprises are already deploying email agents with AgentMail. Agents that convert conversations and documents into structured data. Agents that source quotes, negotiate prices, and get the best deals. Agents that emulate internet users for training models on end-to-end tasks.Here's demo of Clawdbots communicating using AgentMail: https://youtu.be/Y0MfUWS3LKQYou can get started with AgentMail for free at https://agentmail.toLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46812608\nPoints: 114\n# Comments: 133",

We trained this from scratch (not fine-tuned from an existing diffusion model), and have been running it as an API for the past year. Now we're releasing the weights and inference code. Why we're releasing this Most open-source VTON models are either research prototypes that require significant engineering to deploy, or they're locked behind restrictive licenses. As state-of-the-art capabilities consolidate into massive generalist models, we think there's value in releasing focused, efficient models that researchers and developers can actually own, study, and extend commercially. We also want to demonstrate that competitive results in this domain don't require massive compute budgets. Total training cost was in the $5-10k range on rented A100s. This follows our human parser release from a couple weeks ago. Architecture  Core: MMDiT (Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer) with 972M parameters Block structure: 4 patch-mixer + 8 double-stream + 16 single-stream transformer blocks Sampling: Rectified Flow (linear interpolation between noise and data) Conditioning: Person image, garment image, and category (tops/bottoms/one-piece)  Key differentiators Pixel-space operation: Unlike most diffusion models that work in VAE latent space, we operate directly on RGB pixels. This avoids lossy VAE encoding/decoding that can blur fine garment details like textures, patterns, and text. Maskless inference: No segmentation mask is required on the target person. This improves body preservation (no mask leakage artifacts) and allows unconstrained garment volume. The model learns where clothing boundaries should be rather than being told. Practical details  Inference: ~5 seconds on H100, runs on consumer GPUs (RTX 30xx/40xx) Memory: ~8GB VRAM minimum License: Apache-2.0  Links  GitHub: fashn-AI/fashn-vton-1.5 HuggingFace: fashn-ai/fashn-vton-1.5 Project page: fashn.ai/research/vton-1-5  Quick example from fashn_vton import TryOnPipeline from PIL import Image pipeline = TryOnPipeline(weights_dir=\"./weights\") person = Image.open(\"person.jpg\").convert(\"RGB\") garment = Image.open(\"garment.jpg\").convert(\"RGB\") result = pipeline( person_image=person, garment_image=garment, category=\"tops\", ) result.images[0].save(\"output.png\")  Coming soon  HuggingFace Space: Online demo Technical paper: Architecture decisions, training methodology, and design rationale  Happy to answer questions about the architecture, training, or implementation.    submitted by    /u/JYP_Scouter   [link] [comments]",
