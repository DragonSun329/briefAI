      "full_content": "ServiceNow announced a multi-year partnership with OpenAI to bring GPT-5.2 into its AI Control Tower and Xanadu platform, reinforcing ServiceNow’s strategy to focus on enterprise workflows, guardrails, and orchestration rather than building frontier models itself.For enterprise buyers, the deal underscores a broader shift: general-purpose models are becoming interchangeable, while the platforms that control how they’re deployed and governed are where differentiation now lives.ServiceNow lets enterprises develop agents and applications, plug them into existing workflows, and manage orchestration and monitoring through its unified AI Control Tower.  The partnership does not mean ServiceNow will no longer use other models to power its services, said John Aisien, senior vice president of product management at ServiceNow.\"We will remain an open platform. There are things we will partner on with each of the model providers, depending on their expertise. Still, ServiceNow will continue to support a hybrid, multi-model AI strategy where customers can bring any model to our AI platform,” Aisien said in an email to VentureBeat. “Instead of exclusivity, we give enterprise customers maximum flexibility by combining powerful general-purpose models with our own LLMs built for ServiceNow workflows.”What the OpenAI partnership unlocks for ServiceNow customersServiceNow customers get:Voice-first agents: Speech-to-speech and voice-to-text supportEnterprise knowledge access: Q&A grounded in enterprise data, with improved search and discoveryOperational automation: Incident summarization and resolution supportServiceNow said it plans to work directly with OpenAI to build “real-time speech-to-speech AI agents that can listen, reason and respond naturally without text intermediation.” The company is also interested in tapping OpenAI’s computer use models to automate actions across enterprise tools such as email and chat.The enterprise playbookThe partnership reinforces ServiceNow’s positioning as a control layer for enterprise AI, separating general-purpose models from the services that govern how they’re deployed, monitored, and secured. Rather than owning the models, ServiceNow is emphasizing orchestration and guardrails — the layers enterprises increasingly need to scale AI safely.Some companies that work with enterprises see the partnership as a positive. Tom Bachant, co-founder and CEO of AI workflow and support platform Unthread, said this could further reduce integration friction.  “Deeply integrated systems often lower the barrier to entry and simplify initial deployment,\" he told VentureBeat in an email. \"However, as organizations scale AI across core business systems, flexibility becomes more important than standardization. Enterprises ultimately need the ability to adapt performance benchmarks, pricing models, and internal risk postures; none of which remain static over time.”As enterprise AI adoption accelerates, partnerships like this suggest the real battleground is shifting away from the models themselves and toward the platforms that control how those models are used in production.",

      "full_content": "When OpenAI went down in December, one of TrueFoundry’s customers faced a crisis that had nothing to do with chatbots or content generation. The company uses large language models to help refill prescriptions. Every second of downtime meant thousands of dollars in lost revenue — and patients who could not access their medications on time.TrueFoundry, an enterprise AI infrastructure company, announced Wednesday a new product called TrueFailover designed to prevent exactly that scenario. The system automatically detects when AI providers experience outages, slowdowns, or quality degradation, then seamlessly reroutes traffic to backup models and regions before users notice anything went wrong.\"The challenge is that in the AI world, failover is no longer that simple,\" said Nikunj Bajaj, co-founder and chief executive of TrueFoundry, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"When you move from one model to another, you also have to consider things like output quality, latency, and whether the prompt even works the same way. In many cases, the prompt needs to be adjusted in real-time to prevent results from degrading. That is not something most teams are set up to manage manually.\"The announcement arrives at a pivotal moment for enterprise AI adoption. Companies have moved far beyond experimentation. AI now powers prescription refills at pharmacies, generates sales proposals, assists software developers, and handles customer support inquiries. When these systems fail, the consequences ripple through entire organizations.Why enterprise AI systems remain dangerously dependent on single providersLarge language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers have become essential infrastructure for thousands of businesses. But unlike traditional cloud services from Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure — which offer robust uptime guarantees backed by decades of operational experience — AI providers operate complex, resource-intensive systems that remain prone to unexpected failures.\"Major LLM providers experience outages, slowdowns, or latency spikes every few weeks or months, and we regularly see the downstream impact on businesses that rely on a single provider,\" Bajaj told VentureBeat.The December OpenAI outage that affected TrueFoundry's pharmacy customer illustrates the stakes. \"At their scale, even seconds of downtime can translate into thousands of dollars in lost revenue,\" Bajaj explained. \"Beyond the economic impact, there is also a human consequence when patients cannot access prescriptions on time. Because this customer had our failover solution in place, they were able to reroute requests to another model provider within minutes of detecting the outage. Without that setup, recovery would likely have taken hours.\"The problem extends beyond complete outages. Partial failures — where a model slows down or produces lower-quality responses without going fully offline — can quietly destroy user experience and violate service-level agreements. These \"slow but technically up\" scenarios often prove more damaging than dramatic crashes because they evade traditional monitoring systems while steadily eroding performance.Inside the technology that keeps AI applications online when providers failTrueFailover operates as a resilience layer on top of TrueFoundry's AI Gateway, which already processes more than 10 billion requests per month for Fortune 1000 companies. The system weaves together several interconnected capabilities into a unified safety net for enterprise AI.At its core, the product enables multi-model failover by allowing enterprises to define primary and backup models across providers. If OpenAI becomes unavailable, traffic automatically shifts to Anthropic, Google's Gemini, Mistral, or self-hosted alternatives. The routing happens transparently, without requiring application teams to rewrite code or manually intervene.The system extends this protection across geographic boundaries through multi-region and multi-cloud resilience. By distributing AI endpoints across zones and cloud providers, health-based routing can detect problems in specific regions and divert traffic to healthy alternatives. What would otherwise become a global incident transforms into an invisible infrastructure adjustment that users never perceive.Perhaps most critically, TrueFailover employs degradation-aware routing that continuously monitors latency, error rates, and quality signals. \"We look at a combination of signals that together indicate when a model's performance is starting to degrade,\" Bajaj explained. \"Large language models are shared resources. Providers run the same model instance across many customers, so when demand spikes for one user or workload, it can affect everyone else using that model.\"The system watches for rising response times, increasing error rates, and patterns suggesting instability. \"Individually, none of these signals tell the full story,\" Bajaj said. \"But taken together, they allow us to detect early signs that a model is slowing down or becoming unreliable. Those signals feed into an AI-driven system that can decide when and how to reroute traffic before users experience a noticeable drop in quality.\"Strategic caching rounds out the protection by shielding providers from sudden traffic spikes and preventing rate-limit cascades during high-demand periods. This allows systems to absorb demand surges and provider limits without brownouts or throttling surprises.The approach represents a fundamental shift in how enterprises should think about AI reliability. \"TrueFailover is designed to handle that complexity automatically,\" Bajaj said. \"It continuously monitors how models behave across many customers and use cases, looks for early warning signs like rising latency, and takes action before things break. Most individual enterprises do not have that kind of visibility because they are only able to see their own systems.\"The engineering challenge of switching models without sacrificing output qualityOne of the thorniest challenges in AI failover involves maintaining consistent output quality when switching between models. A prompt optimized for GPT-5 may produce different results on Claude or Gemini. TrueFoundry addresses this through several mechanisms that balance speed against precision.\"Some teams rely on the fact that large models have become good enough that small differences in prompts do not materially affect the output,\" Bajaj explained. \"In those cases, switching from one provider to another can happen with some visible impact — that's not ideal, but some teams choose to do it.\"More sophisticated implementations maintain provider-specific prompts for the same application. \"When traffic shifts from one model to another, the prompt shifts with it,\" Bajaj said. \"In that case, failover is not just switching models. It is switching to a configuration that has already been tested.\"TrueFailover automates this process. The system dynamically routes requests and adjusts prompts based on which model handles the query, keeping quality within acceptable ranges without manual intervention. The key, Bajaj emphasized, is that \"failover is planned, not reactive. The logic, prompts, and guardrails are defined ahead of time, which is why end users typically do not notice when a switch happens.\"Importantly, many failover scenarios do not require changing providers at all. \"It can be routing traffic from the same model in one region to another region, such as from the East Coast to the West Coast, where no prompt changes are required,\" Bajaj noted. This geographic flexibility provides a first line of defense before more complex cross-provider switches become necessary.How regulated industries can use AI failover without compromising complianceFor enterprises in healthcare, financial services, and other regulated sectors, the prospect of AI traffic automatically routing to different providers raises immediate compliance concerns. Patient data cannot simply flow to whichever model happens to be available. Financial records require strict controls over where they travel. TrueFoundry built explicit guardrails to address these constraints.\"TrueFailover will never route data to a model or provider that an enterprise has not explicitly approved,\" Bajaj said. \"Everything is controlled through an admin configuration layer where teams set clear guardrails upfront.\"Enterprises define exactly which models qualify for failover, which providers can receive traffic, and even which regions or model categories — such as closed-source versus open-source — are acceptable. Once those rules take effect, TrueFailover operates only within them.\"If a model is not on the approved list, it is simply not an option for routing,\" Bajaj emphasized. \"There is no scenario where traffic is automatically sent somewhere unexpected. The idea is to give teams full control over compliance and data boundaries, while still allowing the system to respond quickly when something goes wrong. That way, reliability improves without compromising security or regulatory requirements.\"This design reflects lessons learned from TrueFoundry's existing enterprise deployments. A Fortune 50 healthcare company already uses the platform to handle more than 500 million IVR calls annually through an agentic AI system. That customer required the ability to run workloads across both cloud and on-premise infrastructure while maintaining strict data residency controls — exactly the kind of hybrid environment where failover policies must be precisely defined.Where automatic failover cannot help and what enterprises must plan forTrueFoundry acknowledges that TrueFailover cannot solve every reliability problem. The system operates within the guardrails enterprises configure, and those configurations determine what protection is possible.\"If a team allows failover from a large, high-capacity model to a much smaller model without adjusting prompts or expectations, TrueFailover cannot guarantee the same output quality,\" Bajaj explained. \"The system can route traffic, but it cannot make a smaller model behave like a larger one without appropriate configuration.\"Infrastructure constraints also limit protection. If an enterprise hosts its own models and all of them run on the same GPU cluster, TrueFailover cannot help when that infrastructure fails. \"When there is no alternate infrastructure available, there is nothing to fail over to,\" Bajaj said.The question of simultaneous multi-provider failures occasionally surfaces in enterprise risk discussions. Bajaj argues this scenario, while theoretically possible, rarely matches reality. \"In practice, 'going down' usually does not mean an entire provider is offline across all models and regions,\" he explained. \"What happens far more often is a slowdown or disruption in a specific model or region because of traffic spikes or capacity issues.\"When that occurs, failover can happen at multiple levels — from on-premise to cloud, cloud to on-premise, one region to another, one model to another, or even within the same provider before switching providers entirely. \"That alone makes it very unlikely that everything fails at once,\" Bajaj said. \"The key point is that reliability is built on layers of redundancy. The more providers, regions, and models that are included in the guardrails, the smaller the chance that users experience a complete outage.\"A startup that built its platform inside Fortune 500 AI deploymentsTrueFoundry has established itself as infrastructure for some of the world's largest AI deployments, providing crucial context for its failover ambitions. The company raised $19 million in Series A funding in February 2025, led by Intel Capital with participation from Eniac Ventures, Peak XV Partners, and Jump Capital. Angel investors including Gokul Rajaram and Mohit Aron also joined the round, bringing total funding to $21 million.The San Francisco-based company was founded in 2021 by Bajaj and co-founders Abhishek Choudhary and Anuraag Gutgutia, all former Meta engineers who met as classmates at IIT Kharagpur. Initially focused on accelerating machine learning deployments, TrueFoundry pivoted to support generative AI capabilities as the technology went mainstream in 2023.The company's customer roster demonstrates enterprise-scale adoption that few AI infrastructure startups can match. Nvidia employs TrueFoundry to build multi-agent systems that optimize GPU cluster utilization across data centers worldwide — a use case where even small improvements in utilization translate into substantial business impact given the insatiable demand for GPU capacity. Adopt AI routes more than 15 million requests and 40 billion input tokens through TrueFoundry's AI Gateway to power its enterprise agentic workflows.Gaming company Games 24x7 serves machine learning models to more than 100 million users through the platform at scales exceeding 200 requests per second. Digital adoption platform Whatfix migrated to a microservices architecture on TrueFoundry, reducing its release cycle sixfold and cutting testing time by 40 percent.TrueFoundry currently reports more than 30 paid customers worldwide and has indicated it exceeded $1.5 million in annual recurring revenue last year while quadrupling its customer base. The company manages more than 1,000 clusters for machine learning workloads across its client base.TrueFailover will be offered as an add-on module on top of the existing TrueFoundry AI Gateway and platform, with pricing following a usage-based model tied to traffic volume along with the number of users, models, providers, and regions involved. An early access program for design partners opens in the coming weeks.Why traditional cloud uptime guarantees may never apply to AI providersEnterprise technology buyers have long demanded uptime commitments from infrastructure providers. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud all offer service-level agreements with financial penalties for failures. Will AI providers eventually face similar expectations?Bajaj sees fundamental constraints that make traditional SLAs difficult to achieve in the current generation of AI infrastructure. \"Most foundational LLMs today operate as shared resources, which is what enables the standard pricing you see publicly advertised,\" he explained. \"Providers do offer higher uptime commitments, but that usually means dedicated capacity or reserved infrastructure, and the cost increases significantly.\"Even with substantial budgets, enterprises face usage quotas that create unexpected exposure. \"If traffic spikes beyond those limits, requests can still spill back into shared infrastructure,\" Bajaj said. \"That makes it hard to achieve the kind of hard guarantees enterprises are used to with cloud providers.\"The economics of running large language models create additional barriers that may persist for years. \"LLMs are still extremely complex and expensive to run. They require massive infrastructure and energy, and we do not expect a near-term future where most companies run multiple, fully dedicated model instances just to guarantee uptime.\"This reality drives demand for solutions like TrueFailover that provide resilience regardless of what individual providers can promise. \"Enterprises are realizing that reliability cannot come from the model provider alone,\" Bajaj said. \"It requires additional layers of protection to handle the realities of how these systems operate today.\"The new calculus for companies that built AI into critical business processesThe timing of TrueFoundry's announcement reflects a fundamental shift in how enterprises use AI — and what they stand to lose when it fails. What began as internal experimentation has evolved into customer-facing applications where disruptions directly affect revenue and reputation.\"Many enterprises experimented with Gen AI and agentic systems in the past, and production use cases were largely internal-facing,\" Bajaj observed. \"There was no immediate impact on their top line or the public perception of the enterprise.\"That era has ended. \"Now that these enterprises have launched public-facing applications, where both the top line and public perception can be impacted if an outage occurs, the stakes are much higher than they were even six months ago. That's why we are seeing more and more attention on this now.\"For companies that have woven AI into critical business processes — from prescription refills to customer support to sales operations — the calculus has changed entirely. The question is no longer which model performs best on benchmarks or which provider offers the most compelling features. The question that now keeps technology leaders awake is far simpler and far more urgent: what happens when the AI disappears at the worst possible moment?Somewhere, a pharmacist is filling a prescription. A customer support agent is resolving a complaint. A sales team is generating a proposal for a deal that closes tomorrow. All of them depend on AI systems that depend on providers that, despite their scale and sophistication, still go dark without warning.TrueFoundry is betting that enterprises will pay handsomely to ensure those moments of darkness never reach the people who matter most — their customers.",

      "full_content": "For the modern CFO, the hardest part of the job often isn't the math—it's the storytelling. After the books are closed and the variances calculated, finance teams spend days, sometimes weeks, manually copy-pasting charts into PowerPoint slides to explain why the numbers moved.Today, 11-year-old Israeli fintech company Datarails announced a set of new generative AI tools designed to automate that \"last mile\" of financial reporting, effectively allowing finance leaders to \"vibe code\" their way to a board deck.Launching today to accompany the firm's newly announced $70 million Series C funding round, the company’s new Strategy, Planning, and Reporting AI Finance Agents promise to answer complex financial questions with fully formatted assets, not just text. A finance professional can now ask, \"What’s driving our profitability changes this year?\" or \"Why did Marketing go over budget last month?\" and the system will instantly generate board-ready PowerPoint slides, PDF reports, or Excel files containing the answer.The deployment of these agents marks a fundamental shift in how the \"Office of the CFO\" interacts with data.Beyond the chatbotThe promise of the new agents is to solve the fragmentation problem that plagues finance departments. Unlike a sales leader who lives in Salesforce, or a CIO who relies on ServiceNow, the CFO has no single \"system of truth\". Data is scattered across ERPs, HRIS, CRMs, and bank portals.A major barrier to AI adoption in finance has been security. CFOs are rightfully hesitant to plug P&L data into public models.Datarails has addressed this by leveraging Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service. \"We use the OpenAI in Azure to ensure the privacy and the security for our customers, they don't like to share the data in [an] open LLM,\" Gurfinkel noted. This allows the platform to utilize state-of-the-art models while keeping data within a secure enterprise perimeter.Datarails’ new agents sit on top of a unified data layer that connects these disparate systems. Because the AI is grounded in the company’s own unified internal data, it avoids the hallucinations common in generic LLMs while offering a level of privacy required for sensitive financial data.\"If the CFO wants to leverage AI on the CFO level or the organization data, they need to consolidate the data,\" explained Datarails CEO and co-founder Didi Gurfinkel in an interview with VentureBeat.By solving that consolidation problem first, Datarails can now offer agents that understand the context of the business. \"Now the CFO can use our agents to run analysis, get insights, create reports... because now the data is ready,\" Gurfinkel said.'Vibe coding' for financeThe launch taps into a broader trend in software development where natural language prompts replace complex coding or manual configuration—a concept tech circles refer to as \"vibe coding.\" Gurfinkel believes this is the future of financial engineering.\"Very soon, the CFO and the financial team themselves will be able to develop applications,\" Gurfinkel predicted. \"The LLMs become so strong that in one prompt, they can replace full product runs.\"He described a workflow where a user could simply prompt: \"That was my budget and my actual of the past year. Now build me the budget for the next year.\"The new agents are designed to handle exactly these types of complex, multi-variable scenarios. For example, a user could ask, \"What happens if revenue grows slower next quarter?\" and receive a scenario analysis in return.Because the output can be delivered as an Excel file, finance teams can verify the formulas and assumptions, maintaining the audit trail that generic AI tools often lack.Ease of adoption: The 'anti-implementation'For most engineering teams, the arrival of a new enterprise financial platform signals a looming headache: months of data migration, schema redesigns, and the inevitable friction of forcing non-technical users to abandon their preferred workflows. Datarails has engineered its way around this friction by building what might be best described as an \"anti-implementation.\"Instead of demanding a \"rip and replace\" of legacy systems, the platform accepts the messy reality of the modern finance stack. The architecture is designed to decouple the data storage from the presentation layer, effectively treating the organization's existing Excel files as a frontend interface while Datarails acts as the backend database.\"We are not replacing anything,\" Gurfinkel explained. \"The implementation can be very fast, from a few hours to maybe a few days\".From a technical perspective, this means the \"engineering\" requirement is almost entirely stripped away. There are no ETL pipelines to build or Python scripts to maintain. The system comes pre-wired with over 200 native connectors—linking directly to ERPs like NetSuite and Sage, CRMs like Salesforce, and various HRIS and bank portals.The heavy lifting is replaced by a \"no-code\" mapping process. A finance analyst, not a developer, maps the fields from their General Ledger to their Excel models in a self-service workflow. For modules like Month-End Close, the company explicitly promises that \"no IT support is needed,\" a phrase that likely comes as a relief to stretched CTOs. Even complex setups, such as the new Cash Management module which requires banking integrations, are typically fully operational within two to three weeks.The result is a system where the \"technical debt\" usually associated with financial transformation is rendered obsolete. The finance team gets their \"single source of truth\" without ever asking engineering to provision a database.From version Control to vision control: a pivot that paid offDatarails wasn't always the \"FinanceOS\" for the AI era. Founded in 2015 by Gurfinkel alongside co-founders Eyal Cohen (COO) and Oded Har-Tal (CTO), the Tel Aviv-based startup spent its early years tackling a dryer problem: version control for Excel. The initial premise was to synchronize and manage spreadsheets across enterprises, but adoption was sluggish as the team struggled to find the right product-market fit.The breakthrough came in 2020 with a strategic pivot. The team realized that finance professionals didn't want to replace Excel with a new dashboard; they wanted to fix Excel's limitations—specifically manual consolidation and data fragmentation. By shifting focus to SMB finance teams and embracing an \"Excel-native\" automation philosophy, the company found its stride.This alignment led to rapid scaling, fueled by a $55 million Series A in June 2021 led by Zeev Ventures, followed quickly by a $50 million Series B in March 2022 led by Qumra Capital. While the company faced headwinds during the tech downturn—resulting in an 18% workforce reduction in late 2022—it has since rebounded aggressively. By 2025, Datarails had nearly doubled its workforce to over 400 employees globally, driven by a multi-product expansion strategy that now includes Month-End Close and Cash Management solutions.Fueling the expansionThe new AI capabilities are supported by the $70 million Series C injection from One Peak, along with existing investors Vertex Growth, Vintage Investment Partners, and others. The funding arrives after a year of 70% revenue growth for Datarails, driven largely by the expansion of its product suite.More than 50% of the company's growth in 2025 came from solutions launched in the last 12 months, including Datarails Month-End Close (a tool for automating reconciliations and workflow management) and Datarails Cash Management (for real-time liquidity monitoring).These products serve as the \"plumbing\" that makes the new AI agents effective. By automating the month-end close and unifying cash data, Datarails ensures that when a CFO asks the AI a question, the underlying numbers are accurate and up-to-date.For Gurfinkel, the goal is to make the finance office \"AI-native\" without forcing users to abandon their favorite tool: Excel.\"We are not replacing anything,\" Gurfinkel said. \"We connect the Excel so Excel now becomes the calculation and the presentation.\"With the launch of these new agents, Datarails is betting that the future of finance isn't about learning new software, but about having a conversation with the data you already have.",

This suggests MemRL could become a critical component for building AI applications that must operate in dynamic real-world settings where requirements and tasks constantly shift.The stability-plasticity dilemmaOne of the central challenges in deploying agentic applications is adapting the underlying model to new knowledge and tasks after the initial training phase. Current approaches generally fall into two categories: parametric approaches, such as fine-tuning, and non-parametric approaches, such as RAG. But both come with significant trade-offs.Fine-tuning, while effective for baking in new information, is computationally expensive and slow. More critically, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon where newly acquired knowledge overwrites previously learned data, degrading the model's general performance.Conversely, non-parametric methods like RAG are fundamentally passive; they retrieve information based solely on semantic similarity, such as vector embeddings, without evaluating the actual utility of the information to the input query. This approach assumes that \"similar implies useful,\" which is often flawed in complex reasoning tasks. The researchers argue that human intelligence solves this problem by maintaining “the delicate balance between the stability of cognitive reasoning and the plasticity of episodic memory.” In the human brain, stable reasoning (associated with the cortex) is decoupled from dynamic episodic memory. This allows humans to adapt to new tasks without \"rewiring neural circuitry\" (the rough equivalent of model fine-tuning).Inside the MemRL frameworkInspired by humans’ use of episodic memory and cognitive reasoning, MemRL is designed to enable an agent to continuously improve its performance after deployment without compromising the stability of its backbone LLM. Instead of changing the model’s parameters, the framework shifts the adaptation mechanism to an external, self-evolving memory structure.In this architecture, the LLM's parameters remain completely frozen. The model acts effectively as the \"cortex,\" responsible for general reasoning, logic, and code generation, but it is not responsible for storing specific successes or failures encountered after deployment. This structure ensures stable cognitive reasoning and prevents catastrophic forgetting.To handle adaptation, MemRL maintains a dynamic episodic memory component. Instead of storing plain text documents and static embedding values, as is common in RAG, MemRL organizes memory into \"intent-experience-utility\" triplets. These contain the user's query (the intent), the specific solution trajectory or action taken (the experience), and a score, known as the Q-value, that represents how successful this specific experience was in the past (the utility).Crucially for enterprise architects, this new data structure doesn't require ripping out existing infrastructure. \"MemRL is designed to be a 'drop-in' replacement for the retrieval layer in existing technology stacks and is compatible with various vector databases,\" Muning Wen, a co-author of the paper and PhD candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, told VentureBeat. \"The existence and updating of 'Q-Value' is solely for better evaluation and management of dynamic data... and is independent of the storage format.\"This utility score is the key differentiator from classic RAG systems. At inference time, MemRL agents employ a \"two-phase retrieval\" mechanism. First, the system identifies memories that are semantically close to the query to ensure relevance. It then re-ranks these candidates based on their Q-value, effectively prioritizing proven strategies.The framework incorporates reinforcement learning directly into the memory retrieval process. When an agent attempts a solution and receives environmental feedback (i.e., success or failure) it updates the Q-value of the retrieved memory. This creates a closed feedback loop: over time, the agent learns to ignore distractor memories and prioritize high-value strategies without ever needing to retrain the underlying LLM.While adding a reinforcement learning step might sound like it adds significant latency, Wen noted that the computational overhead is minimal. \"Our Q-value calculation is performed entirely on the CPU,\" he said.MemRL also possesses runtime continual learning capabilities. When the agent encounters a new scenario, the system uses the frozen LLM to summarize the new trajectory and adds it to the memory bank as a new triplet. This allows the agent to expand its knowledge base dynamically as it interacts with the world.It is worth noting that the automation of the value assignment comes with a risk: If the system mistakenly validates a bad interaction, the agent could learn the wrong lesson. Wen acknowledges this \"poisoned memory\" risk but notes that unlike black-box neural networks, MemRL remains transparent and auditable. \"If a bad interaction is mistakenly classified as a positive example... it may spread more widely,\" Wen said. \"However … we can easily fix it by removing the contaminated data from the memory bank or resetting their Q-values.\"MemRL in actionThe researchers evaluated MemRL against several baselines on four diverse industry benchmarks: BigCodeBench (code generation), ALFWorld (embodied navigation), Lifelong Agent Bench (OS and database interaction), and Humanity's Last Exam (complex multidisciplinary reasoning). The results showed that MemRL consistently outperformed baselines in both runtime learning (improving during the session) and transfer learning (generalizing to unseen tasks).The advantages of this value-aware retrieval mechanism were most pronounced in exploration-heavy environments like ALFWorld. In this benchmark, which requires agents to navigate and interact with a simulated household environment, MemRL achieved a relative improvement of approximately 56% over MemP, another agentic memory framework. The researchers found that the reinforcement learning component effectively encouraged the agent to explore and discover solutions for complex tasks that similarity-based retrieval methods often failed to solve.When the memory bank was frozen and tested on held-out sets to measure generalization, MemRL achieved the highest accuracy across benchmarks. For example, on the Lifelong Agent Bench, it improved significantly upon the standard RAG baseline on OS tasks. This indicates that the system does not merely memorize training data but effectively filters out low-value memories to retain high-utility experiences that generalize to new situations.The broader picture for self-evolving agentsMemRL fits within a growing body of research focused on Memory-Based Markov Decision Processes (M-MDP), a formulation that frames memory retrieval as an active decision-making step rather than a passive search function. By treating retrieval as an action that can be optimized via reinforcement learning, frameworks like MemRL and similar approaches such as Memento are paving the way for more autonomous systems. For enterprise AI, this shift is significant. It suggests a future where agents can be deployed with a general-purpose LLM and then rapidly adapt to specific company workflows, proprietary databases, and unique problem sets through interaction alone. The key shift we’re seeing is frameworks that are treating applications as dynamic environments that they can learn from.These emerging capabilities will allow organizations to maintain consistent, high-performance agents that evolve alongside their business needs, solving the problem of stale models without incurring the prohibitive costs of constant retraining.It marks a transition in how we value data. \"In a future where static data is about to be exhausted, the interaction experience generated by each intelligent agent during its lifespan will become the new fuel,\" Wen said.",

Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.",

      "full_content": "Railway, a San Francisco-based cloud platform that has quietly amassed two million developers without spending a dollar on marketing, announced Thursday that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, as surging demand for artificial intelligence applications exposes the limitations of legacy cloud infrastructure.TQ Ventures led the round, with participation from FPV Ventures, Redpoint, and Unusual Ventures. The investment values Railway as one of the most significant infrastructure startups to emerge during the AI boom, capitalizing on developer frustration with the complexity and cost of traditional platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.\"As AI models get better at writing code, more and more people are asking the age-old question: where, and how, do I run my applications?\" said Jake Cooper, Railway's 28-year-old founder and chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"The last generation of cloud primitives were slow and outdated, and now with AI moving everything faster, teams simply can't keep up.\"The funding is a dramatic acceleration for a company that has charted an unconventional path through the cloud computing industry. Railway raised just $24 million in total before this round, including a $20 million Series A from Redpoint in 2022. The company now processes more than 10 million deployments monthly and handles over one trillion requests through its edge network — metrics that rival far larger and better-funded competitors.Why three-minute deploy times have become unacceptable in the age of AI coding assistantsRailway's pitch rests on a simple observation: the tools developers use to deploy and manage software were designed for a slower era. A standard build-and-deploy cycle using Terraform, the industry-standard infrastructure tool, takes two to three minutes. That delay, once tolerable, has become a critical bottleneck as AI coding assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor can generate working code in seconds.\"When godly intelligence is on tap and can solve any problem in three seconds, those amalgamations of systems become bottlenecks,\" Cooper told VentureBeat. \"What was really cool for humans to deploy in 10 seconds or less is now table stakes for agents.\"The company claims its platform delivers deployments in under one second — fast enough to keep pace with AI-generated code. Customers report a tenfold increase in developer velocity and up to 65 percent cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.These numbers come directly from enterprise clients, not internal benchmarks. Daniel Lobaton, chief technology officer at G2X, a platform serving 100,000 federal contractors, measured deployment speed improvements of seven times faster and an 87 percent cost reduction after migrating to Railway. His infrastructure bill dropped from $15,000 per month to approximately $1,000.\"The work that used to take me a week on our previous infrastructure, I can do in Railway in like a day,\" Lobaton said. \"If I want to spin up a new service and test different architectures, it would take so long on our old setup. In Railway I can launch six services in two minutes.\"Inside the controversial decision to abandon Google Cloud and build data centers from scratchWhat distinguishes Railway from competitors like Render and Fly.io is the depth of its vertical integration. In 2024, the company made the unusual decision to abandon Google Cloud entirely and build its own data centers, a move that echoes the famous Alan Kay maxim: \"People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.\"\"We wanted to design hardware in a way where we could build a differentiated experience,\" Cooper said. \"Having full control over the network, compute, and storage layers lets us do really fast build and deploy loops, the kind that allows us to move at 'agentic speed' while staying 100 percent the smoothest ride in town.\"The approach paid dividends during recent widespread outages that affected major cloud providers — Railway remained online throughout.This soup-to-nuts control enables pricing that undercuts the hyperscalers by roughly 50 percent and newer cloud startups by three to four times. Railway charges by the second for actual compute usage: $0.00000386 per gigabyte-second of memory, $0.00000772 per vCPU-second, and $0.00000006 per gigabyte-second of storage. There are no charges for idle virtual machines — a stark contrast to the traditional cloud model where customers pay for provisioned capacity whether they use it or not.\"The conventional wisdom is that the big guys have economies of scale to offer better pricing,\" Cooper noted. \"But when they're charging for VMs that usually sit idle in the cloud, and we've purpose-built everything to fit much more density on these machines, you have a big opportunity.\"How 30 employees built a platform generating tens of millions in annual revenueRailway has achieved its scale with a team of just 30 employees generating tens of millions in annual revenue — a ratio of revenue per employee that would be exceptional even for established software companies. The company grew revenue 3.5 times last year and continues to expand at 15 percent month-over-month.Cooper emphasized that the fundraise was strategic rather than necessary. \"We're default alive; there's no reason for us to raise money,\" he said. \"We raised because we see a massive opportunity to accelerate, not because we needed to survive.\"The company hired its first salesperson only last year and employs just two solutions engineers. Nearly all of Railway's two million users discovered the platform through word of mouth — developers telling other developers about a tool that actually works.\"We basically did the standard engineering thing: if you build it, they will come,\" Cooper recalled. \"And to some degree, they came.\"From side projects to Fortune 500 deployments: Railway's unlikely corporate expansionDespite its grassroots developer community, Railway has made significant inroads into large organizations. The company claims that 31 percent of Fortune 500 companies now use its platform, though deployments range from company-wide infrastructure to individual team projects.Notable customers include Bilt, the loyalty program company; Intuit's GoCo subsidiary; TripAdvisor's Cruise Critic; and MGM Resorts. Kernel, a Y Combinator-backed startup providing AI infrastructure to over 1,000 companies, runs its entire customer-facing system on Railway for $444 per month.\"At my previous company Clever, which sold for $500 million, I had six full-time engineers just managing AWS,\" said Rafael Garcia, Kernel's chief technology officer. \"Now I have six engineers total, and they all focus on product. Railway is exactly the tool I wish I had in 2012.\"For enterprise customers, Railway offers security certifications including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and HIPAA readiness, with business associate agreements available upon request. The platform provides single sign-on authentication, comprehensive audit logs, and the option to deploy within a customer's existing cloud environment through a \"bring your own cloud\" configuration.Enterprise pricing starts at custom levels, with specific add-ons for extended log retention ($200 monthly), HIPAA BAAs ($1,000), enterprise support with SLOs ($2,000), and dedicated virtual machines ($10,000).The startup's bold strategy to take on Amazon, Google, and a new generation of cloud rivalsRailway enters a crowded market that includes not only the hyperscale cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—but also a growing cohort of developer-focused platforms like Vercel, Render, Fly.io, and Heroku.Cooper argues that Railway's competitors fall into two camps, neither of which has fully committed to the new infrastructure model that AI demands.\"The hyperscalers have two competing systems, and they haven't gone all-in on the new model because their legacy revenue stream is still printing money,\" he observed. \"They have this mammoth pool of cash coming from people who provision a VM, use maybe 10 percent of it, and still pay for the whole thing. To what end are they actually interested in going all the way in on a new experience if they don't really need to?\"Against startup competitors, Railway differentiates by covering the full infrastructure stack. \"We're not just containers; we've got VM primitives, stateful storage, virtual private networking, automated load balancing,\" Cooper said. \"And we wrap all of this in an absurdly easy-to-use UI, with agentic primitives so agents can move 1,000 times faster.\"The platform supports databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis; provides up to 256 terabytes of persistent storage with over 100,000 input/output operations per second; and enables deployment to four global regions spanning the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Enterprise customers can scale to 112 vCPUs and 2 terabytes of RAM per service.Why investors are betting that AI will create a thousand times more software than exists todayRailway's fundraise reflects broader investor enthusiasm for companies positioned to benefit from the AI coding revolution. As tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude become standard fixtures in developer workflows, the volume of code being written — and the infrastructure needed to run it — is expanding dramatically.\"The amount of software that's going to come online over the next five years is unfathomable compared to what existed before — we're talking a thousand times more software,\" Cooper predicted. \"All of that has to run somewhere.\"The company has already integrated directly with AI systems, building what Cooper calls \"loops where Claude can hook in, call deployments, and analyze infrastructure automatically.\" Railway released a Model Context Protocol server in August 2025 that allows AI coding agents to deploy applications and manage infrastructure directly from code editors.\"The notion of a developer is melting before our eyes,\" Cooper said. \"You don't have to be an engineer to engineer things anymore — you just need critical thinking and the ability to analyze things in a systems capacity.\"What Railway plans to do with $100 million and zero marketing experienceRailway plans to use the new capital to expand its global data center footprint, grow its team beyond 30 employees, and build what Cooper described as a proper go-to-market operation for the first time in the company's five-year history.\"One of my mentors said you raise money when you can change the trajectory of the business,\" Cooper explained. \"We've built all the required substrate to scale indefinitely; what's been holding us back is simply talking about it. 2026 is the year we play on the world stage.\"The company's investor roster reads like a who's who of developer infrastructure. Angel investors include Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Guillermo Rauch, chief executive of Vercel; Spencer Kimball, chief executive of Cockroach Labs; Olivier Pomel, chief executive of Datadog; and Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear.The timing of Railway's expansion coincides with what many in Silicon Valley view as a fundamental shift in how software gets made. Coding assistants are no longer experimental curiosities — they have become essential tools that millions of developers rely on daily. Each line of AI-generated code needs somewhere to run, and the incumbents, by Cooper's telling, are too wedded to their existing business models to fully capitalize on the moment.Whether Railway can translate developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise adoption remains an open question. The cloud infrastructure market is littered with promising startups that failed to break the grip of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. But Cooper, who previously worked as a software engineer at Wolfram Alpha, Bloomberg, and Uber before founding Railway in 2020, seems unfazed by the scale of his ambition.\"In five years, Railway [will be] the place where software gets created and evolved, period,\" he said. \"Deploy instantly, scale infinitely, with zero friction. That's the prize worth playing for, and there's no bigger one on offer.\"For a company that built a $100 million business by doing the opposite of what conventional startup wisdom dictates — no marketing, no sales team, no venture hype—the real test begins now. Railway spent five years proving that developers would find a better mousetrap on their own. The next five will determine whether the rest of the world is ready to get on board.",
