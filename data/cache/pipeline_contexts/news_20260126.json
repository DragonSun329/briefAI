      "content": "Security teams are buying AI defenses that don't work. Researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind published findings in October 2025 that should stop every CISO mid-procurement. Their paper, \"The Attacker Moves Second: Stronger Adaptive Attacks Bypass Defenses Against Llm Jailbreaks and Prompt Injections,\" tested 12 published AI defenses, with most claiming near-zero attack success rates. The research team achieved bypass rates above 90% on most defenses. The implication for enterprises is stark: Most AI security products are being tested against attackers that don’t behave like real attackers.The team tested prompting-based, training-based, and filtering-based defenses under adaptive attack conditions. All collapsed. Prompting defenses achieved 95% to 99% attack success rates under adaptive attacks. Training-based methods fared no better, with bypass rates hitting 96% to 100%. The researchers designed a rigorous methodology to stress-test those claims. Their approach included 14 authors and a $20,000 prize pool for successful attacks.Why WAFs fail at the inference layerWeb application firewalls (WAFs) are stateless; AI attacks are not. The distinction explains why traditional security controls collapse against modern prompt injection techniques.The researchers threw known jailbreak techniques at these defenses. Crescendo exploits conversational context by breaking a malicious request into innocent-looking fragments spread across up to 10 conversational turns and building rapport until the model finally complies. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is an automated attack that generates jailbreak suffixes through gradient-based optimization. These are not theoretical attacks. They are published methodologies with working code. A stateless filter catches none of it.Each attack exploited a different blind spot — context loss, automation, or semantic obfuscation — but all succeeded for the same reason: the defenses assumed static behavior.\"A phrase as innocuous as 'ignore previous instructions' or a Base64-encoded payload can be as devastating to an AI application as a buffer overflow was to traditional software,\" said Carter Rees, VP of AI at Reputation. \"The difference is that AI attacks operate at the semantic layer, which signature-based detection cannot parse.\"Why AI deployment is outpacing securityThe failure of today’s defenses would be concerning on its own, but the timing makes it dangerous.Gartner predicts 40% of enterprise applications will integrate AI agents by the end of 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025. The deployment curve is vertical. The security curve is flat.Adam Meyers, SVP of Counter Adversary Operations at CrowdStrike, quantifies the speed gap: \"The fastest breakout time we observed was 51 seconds. So, these adversaries are getting faster, and this is something that makes the defender's job a lot harder.\" The CrowdStrike 2025 Global Threat Report found 79% of detections were malware-free, with adversaries using hands-on keyboard techniques that bypass traditional endpoint defenses entirely.In September 2025, Anthropic disrupted the first documented AI-orchestrated cyber operation. The attack saw attackers execute thousands of requests, often multiple per second, with human involvement dropping to just 10 to 20% of total effort. Traditional three- to six-month campaigns compressed to 24 to 48 hours. Among organizations that suffered AI-related breaches, 97% lacked access controls, according to the IBM 2025 Cost of a Data Breach ReportMeyers explains the shift in attacker tactics: \"Threat actors have figured out that trying to bring malware into the modern enterprise is kind of like trying to walk into an airport with a water bottle; you're probably going to get stopped by security. Rather than bringing in the 'water bottle,' they've had to find a way to avoid detection. One of the ways they've done that is by not bringing in malware at all.\"Jerry Geisler, EVP and CISO of Walmart, sees agentic AI compounding these risks. \"The adoption of agentic AI introduces entirely new security threats that bypass traditional controls,\" Geisler told VentureBeat previously. \"These risks span data exfiltration, autonomous misuse of APIs, and covert cross-agent collusion, all of which could disrupt enterprise operations or violate regulatory mandates.\"Four attacker profiles already exploiting AI defense gapsThese failures aren’t hypothetical. They’re already being exploited across four distinct attacker profiles.The paper's authors make a critical observation that defense mechanisms eventually appear in internet-scale training data. Security through obscurity provides no protection when the models themselves learn how defenses work and adapt on the fly.Anthropic tests against 200-attempt adaptive campaigns while OpenAI reports single-attempt resistance, highlighting how inconsistent industry testing standards remain. The research paper's authors used both approaches. Every defense still fell.Rees maps four categories now exploiting the inference layer.External adversaries operationalize published attack research. Crescendo, GCG, ArtPrompt. They adapt their approach to each defense's specific design, exactly as the researchers did.Malicious B2B clients exploit legitimate API access to reverse-engineer proprietary training data or extract intellectual property through inference attacks. The research found reinforcement learning attacks particularly effective in black-box scenarios, requiring just 32 sessions of five rounds each.Compromised API consumers leverage trusted credentials to exfiltrate sensitive outputs or poison downstream systems through manipulated responses. The paper found output filtering failed as badly as input filtering. Search-based attacks systematically generated adversarial triggers that evaded detection, meaning bi-directional controls offered no additional protection when attackers adapted their techniques.Negligent insiders remain the most common vector and the most expensive. The IBM 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report found that shadow AI added $670,000 to average breach costs. \"The most prevalent threat is often the negligent insider,\" Rees said. \"This 'shadow AI' phenomenon involves employees pasting sensitive proprietary code into public LLMs to increase efficiency. They view security as friction. Samsung's engineers learned this when proprietary semiconductor code was submitted to ChatGPT, which retains user inputs for model training.\"Why stateless detection fails against conversational attacksThe research points to specific architectural requirements. Normalization before semantic analysis to defeat encoding and obfuscation Context tracking across turns to detect multi-step attacks like Crescendo Bi-directional filtering to prevent data exfiltration through outputsJamie Norton, CISO at the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and vice chair of ISACA's board of directors, captures the governance challenge: \"As CISOs, we don't want to get in the way of innovation, but we have to put guardrails around it so that we're not charging off into the wilderness and our data is leaking out,\" Norton told CSO Online.Seven questions to ask AI security vendorsVendors will claim near-zero attack success rates, but the research proves those numbers collapse under adaptive pressure. Security leaders need answers to these questions before any procurement conversation starts, as each one maps directly to a failure documented in the research.What is your bypass rate against adaptive attackers? Not against static test sets. Against attackers who know how the defense works and have time to iterate. Any vendor citing near-zero rates without an adaptive testing methodology is selling a false sense of security.How does your solution detect multi-turn attacks? Crescendo spreads malicious requests across 10 turns that look benign in isolation. Stateless filters will catch none of it. If the vendor says stateless, the conversation is over.How do you handle encoded payloads? ArtPrompt hides malicious instructions in ASCII art. Base64 and Unicode obfuscation slip past text-based filters entirely. Normalization before analysis is table stakes. Signature matching alone means the product is blind.Does your solution filter outputs as well as inputs? Input-only controls cannot prevent data exfiltration through model responses. Ask what happens when both layers face coordinated attack.How do you track context across conversation turns? Conversational AI requires stateful analysis. If the vendor cannot explain implementation specifics, they do not have them.How do you test against attackers who understand your defense mechanism? The research shows defenses fail when attackers adapt to the specific protection design. Security through obscurity provides no protection at the inference layer.What is your mean time to update defenses against novel attack patterns? Attack methodologies are public. New variants emerge weekly. A defense that cannot adapt faster than attackers will fall behind permanently.The bottom lineThe research from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind delivers an uncomfortable verdict. The AI defenses protecting enterprise deployments today were designed for attackers who do not adapt. Real attackers adapt. Every enterprise running LLMs in production should audit current controls against the attack methodologies documented in this research. The deployment curve is vertical, but the security curve is flat. That gap is where breaches will happen.",

      "content": "Despite lots of hype, \"voice AI\" has so far largely been a euphemism for a request-response loop. You speak, a cloud server transcribes your words, a language model thinks, and a robotic voice reads the text back. Functional, but not really conversational. That all changed in the past week with a rapid succession of powerful, fast, and more capable voice AI model releases from Nvidia, Inworld, FlashLabs, and Alibaba's Qwen team, combined with a massive talent acquisition and tech licensing deal by Google DeepMind and Hume AI.Now, the industry has effectively solved the four \"impossible\" problems of voice computing: latency, fluidity, efficiency, and emotion.For enterprise builders, the implications are immediate. We have moved from the era of \"chatbots that speak\" to the era of \"empathetic interfaces.\" Here is how the landscape has shifted, the specific licensing models for each new tool, and what it means for the next generation of applications.1. The death of latency – no more awkward pausesThe \"magic number\" in human conversation is roughly 200 milliseconds. That is the typical gap between one person finishing a sentence and another beginning theirs. Anything longer than 500ms feels like a satellite delay; anything over a second breaks the illusion of intelligence entirely.Until now, chaining together ASR (speech recognition), LLMs (intelligence), and TTS (text-to-speech) resulted in latencies of 2–5 seconds.Inworld AI’s release of TTS 1.5 directly attacks this bottleneck. By achieving a P90 latency of under 120ms, Inworld has effectively pushed the technology faster than human perception. For developers building customer service agents or interactive training avatars, this means the \"thinking pause\" is dead. Crucially, Inworld claims this model achieves \"viseme-level synchronization,\" meaning the lip movements of a digital avatar will match the audio frame-by-frame—a requirement for high-fidelity gaming and VR training.It's vailable via commercial API (pricing tiers based on usage) with a free tier for testing.Simultaneously, FlashLabs released Chroma 1.0, an end-to-end model that integrates the listening and speaking phases. By processing audio tokens directly via an interleaved text-audio token schedule (1:2 ratio), the model bypasses the need to convert speech to text and back again. This \"streaming architecture\" allows the model to generate acoustic codes while it is still generating text, effectively \"thinking out loud\" in data form before the audio is even synthesized. This one is open source on Hugging Face under the enterprise-friendly, commercially viable Apache 2.0 license. Together, they signal that speed is no longer a differentiator; it is a commodity. If your voice application has a 3-second delay, it is now obsolete. The standard for 2026 is immediate, interruptible response.2. Solving \"the robot problem\" via full duplexSpeed is useless if the AI is rude. Traditional voice bots are \"half-duplex\"—like a walkie-talkie, they cannot listen while they are speaking. If you try to interrupt a banking bot to correct a mistake, it keeps talking over you.Nvidia's PersonaPlex, released last week, introduces a 7-billion parameter \"full-duplex\" model. Built on the Moshi architecture (originally from Kyutai), it uses a dual-stream design: one stream for listening (via the Mimi neural audio codec) and one for speaking (via the Helium language model). This allows the model to update its internal state while the user is speaking, enabling it to handle interruptions gracefully.Crucially, it understands \"backchanneling\"—the non-verbal \"uh-huhs,\" \"rights,\" and \"okays\" that humans use to signal active listening without taking the floor. This is a subtle but profound shift for UI design. An AI that can be interrupted allows for efficiency. A customer can cut off a long legal disclaimer by saying, \"I got it, move on,\" and the AI will instantly pivot. This mimics the dynamics of a high-competence human operator.The model weights are released under the Nvidia Open Model License (permissive for commercial use but with attribution/distribution terms), while the code is MIT Licensed.3. High-fidelity compression leads to smaller data footprintsWhile Inworld and Nvidia focused on speed and behavior, open source AI powerhouse Qwen (parent company Alibaba Cloud) quietly solved the bandwidth problem.Earlier today, the team released Qwen3-TTS, featuring a breakthrough 12Hz tokenizer. In plain English, this means the model can represent high-fidelity speech using an incredibly small amount of data—just 12 tokens per second.For comparison, previous state-of-the-art models required significantly higher token rates to maintain audio quality. Qwen’s benchmarks show it outperforming competitors like FireredTTS 2 on key reconstruction metrics (MCD, CER, WER) while using fewer tokens.Why does this matter for the enterprise? Cost and scale. A model that requires less data to generate speech is cheaper to run and faster to stream, especially on edge devices or in low-bandwidth environments (like a field technician using a voice assistant on a 4G connection). It turns high-quality voice AI from a server-hogging luxury into a lightweight utility.It's available on Hugging Face now under a permissive Apache 2.0 license, perfect for research and commercial application.4. The missing 'it' factor: emotional intelligencePerhaps the most significant news of the week—and the most complex—is Google DeepMind’s move to license Hume AI’s technology and hire its CEO, Alan Cowen, along with key research staff.While Google integrates this tech into Gemini to power the next generation of consumer assistants, Hume AI itself is pivoting to become the infrastructure backbone for the enterprise. Under new CEO Andrew Ettinger, Hume is doubling down on the thesis that \"emotion\" is not a UI feature, but a data problem.In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat regarding the transition, Ettinger explained that as voice becomes the primary interface, the current stack is insufficient because it treats all inputs as flat text.\"I saw firsthand how the frontier labs are using data to drive model accuracy,\" Ettinger says. \"Voice is very clearly emerging as the de facto interface for AI. If you see that happening, you would also conclude that emotional intelligence around that voice is going to be critical—dialects, understanding, reasoning, modulation.\"The challenge for enterprise builders has been that LLMs are sociopaths by design—they predict the next word, not the emotional state of the user. A healthcare bot that sounds cheerful when a patient reports chronic pain is a liability. A financial bot that sounds bored when a client reports fraud is a churn risk.Ettinger emphasizes that this isn't just about making bots sound nice; it's about competitive advantage. When asked about the increasingly competitive landscape and the role of open source versus proprietary models, Ettinger remained pragmatic. He noted that while open-source models like PersonaPlex are raising the baseline for interaction, the proprietary advantage lies in the data—specifically, the high-quality, emotionally annotated speech data that Hume has spent years collecting.\"The team at Hume ran headfirst into a problem shared by nearly every team building voice models today: the lack of high-quality, emotionally annotated speech data for post-training,\" he wrote on LinkedIn. \"Solving this required rethinking how audio data is sourced, labeled, and evaluated... This is our advantage. Emotion isn't a feature; it's a foundation.\"Hume’s models and data infrastructure are available via proprietary enterprise licensing.5. The new enterprise voice AI playbookWith these pieces in place, the \"Voice Stack\" for 2026 looks radically different.The Brain: An LLM (like Gemini or GPT-4o) provides the reasoning.The Body: Efficient, open-weight models like PersonaPlex (Nvidia), Chroma (FlashLabs), or Qwen3-TTS handle the turn-taking, synthesis, and compression, allowing developers to host their own highly responsive agents.The Soul: Platforms like Hume provide the annotated data and emotional weighting to ensure the AI \"reads the room,\" preventing the reputational damage of a tone-deaf bot.Ettinger claims the market demand for this specific \"emotional layer\" is exploding beyond just tech assistants.\"We are seeing that very deeply with the frontier labs, but also in healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing,\" Ettinger told me. \"As people try to get applications into the hands of thousands of workers across the globe who have complex SKUs... we’re seeing dozens and dozens of use cases by the day.\"This aligns with his comments on LinkedIn, where he revealed that Hume signed \"multiple 8-figure contracts in January alone,\" validating the thesis that enterprises are willing to pay a premium for AI that doesn't just understand what a customer said, but how they felt.From good enough to actually goodFor years, enterprise voice AI was graded on a curve. If it understood the user’s intent 80% of the time, it was a success.The technologies released this week have removed the technical excuses for bad experiences. Latency is solved. Interruption is solved. Bandwidth is solved. Emotional nuance is solvable.\"Just like GPUs became foundational for training models,\" Ettinger wrote on his LinkedIn, \"emotional intelligence will be the foundational layer for AI systems that actually serve human well-being.\"For the CIO or CTO, the message is clear: The friction has been removed from the interface. The only remaining friction is in how quickly organizations can adopt the new stack.",

      "content": "While vector databases still have many valid use cases, organizations including OpenAI are leaning on PostgreSQL to get things done.In a blog post on Thursday, OpenAI disclosed how it is using the open-source PostgreSQL database.OpenAI runs ChatGPT and its API platform for 800 million users on a single-primary PostgreSQL instance — not a distributed database, not a sharded cluster. One Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server handles all writes. Nearly 50 read replicas spread across multiple regions handle reads. The system processes millions of queries per second while maintaining low double-digit millisecond p99 latency and five-nines availability.The setup challenges conventional scaling wisdom and offers enterprise architects insight into what actually works at massive scale.The lesson here isn’t to copy OpenAI’s stack. It’s that architectural decisions should be driven by workload patterns and operational constraints — not by scale panic or fashionable infrastructure choices. OpenAI’s PostgreSQL setup shows how far proven systems can stretch when teams optimize deliberately instead of re-architecting prematurely.\"For years, PostgreSQL has been one of the most critical, under-the-hood data systems powering core products like ChatGPT and OpenAI’s API,\"  OpenAI engineer Bohan Zhang wrote in a technical disclosure. \"Over the past year, our PostgreSQL load has grown by more than 10x, and it continues to rise quickly.\"The company achieved this scale through targeted optimizations, including connection pooling that cut connection time from 50 milliseconds to 5 milliseconds and cache locking to prevent 'thundering herd' problems where cache misses trigger database overload.Why PostgreSQL matters for enterprisesPostgreSQL handles operational data for ChatGPT and OpenAI's API platform. The workload is heavily read-oriented, which makes PostgreSQL a good fit. However, PostgreSQL's multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) creates challenges under heavy write loads. When updating data, PostgreSQL copies entire rows to create new versions, causing write amplification and forcing queries to scan through multiple versions to find current data.  Rather than fighting this limitation, OpenAI built its strategy around it. At OpenAI’s scale, these tradeoffs aren’t theoretical — they determine which workloads stay on PostgreSQL and which ones must move elsewhere.How OpenAI is optimizing PostgreSQLAt large scale, conventional database wisdom points to one of two paths: shard PostgreSQL across multiple primary instances so writes can be distributed, or migrate to a distributed SQL database like CockroachDB or YugabyteDB designed to handle massive scale from the start. Most organizations would have taken one of these paths years ago, well before reaching 800 million users.Sharding or moving to a distributed SQL database eliminates the single-writer bottleneck. A distributed SQL database handles this coordination automatically, but both approaches introduce significant complexity: application code must route queries to the correct shard, distributed transactions become harder to manage and operational overhead increases substantially.Instead of sharding PostgreSQL, OpenAI established a hybrid strategy: no new tables in PostgreSQL. New workloads default to sharded systems like Azure Cosmos DB. Existing write-heavy workloads that can be horizontally partitioned get migrated out. Everything else stays in PostgreSQL with aggressive optimization.This approach offers enterprises a practical alternative to wholesale re-architecture. Rather than spending years rewriting hundreds of endpoints, teams can identify specific bottlenecks and move only those workloads to purpose-built systems.  Why this matters OpenAI's experience scaling PostgreSQL reveals several practices that enterprises can adopt regardless of their scale.Build operational defenses at multiple layers. OpenAI's approach combines cache locking to prevent \"thundering herd\" problems, connection pooling (which dropped their connection time from 50ms to 5ms), and rate limiting at application, proxy and query levels. Workload isolation routes low-priority and high-priority traffic to separate instances, ensuring a poorly optimized new feature can't degrade core services. Review and monitor ORM-generated SQL in production. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Django, SQLAlchemy, and Hibernate automatically generate database queries from application code, which is convenient for developers. However, OpenAI found one ORM-generated query joining 12 tables that caused multiple high-severity incidents when traffic spiked. The convenience of letting frameworks generate SQL creates hidden scaling risks that only surface under production load. Make reviewing these queries a standard practice.Enforce strict operational discipline. OpenAI permits only lightweight schema changes — anything triggering a full table rewrite is prohibited. Schema changes have a 5-second timeout. Long-running queries get automatically terminated to prevent blocking database maintenance operations. When backfilling data, they enforce rate limits so aggressive that operations can take over a week. Read-heavy workloads with burst writes can run on single-primary PostgreSQL longer than commonly assumed. The decision to shard should depend on workload patterns rather than user counts.This approach is particularly relevant for AI applications, which often have heavily read-oriented workloads with unpredictable traffic spikes. These characteristics align with the pattern where single-primary PostgreSQL scales effectively.The lesson is straightforward: identify actual bottlenecks, optimize proven infrastructure where possible, and migrate selectively when necessary. Wholesale re-architecture isn't always the answer to scaling challenges.",

      "content": "Railway, a San Francisco-based cloud platform that has quietly amassed two million developers without spending a dollar on marketing, announced Thursday that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, as surging demand for artificial intelligence applications exposes the limitations of legacy cloud infrastructure.TQ Ventures led the round, with participation from FPV Ventures, Redpoint, and Unusual Ventures. The investment values Railway as one of the most significant infrastructure startups to emerge during the AI boom, capitalizing on developer frustration with the complexity and cost of traditional platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.\"As AI models get better at writing code, more and more people are asking the age-old question: where, and how, do I run my applications?\" said Jake Cooper, Railway's 28-year-old founder and chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"The last generation of cloud primitives were slow and outdated, and now with AI moving everything faster, teams simply can't keep up.\"The funding is a dramatic acceleration for a company that has charted an unconventional path through the cloud computing industry. Railway raised just $24 million in total before this round, including a $20 million Series A from Redpoint in 2022. The company now processes more than 10 million deployments monthly and handles over one trillion requests through its edge network — metrics that rival far larger and better-funded competitors.Why three-minute deploy times have become unacceptable in the age of AI coding assistantsRailway's pitch rests on a simple observation: the tools developers use to deploy and manage software were designed for a slower era. A standard build-and-deploy cycle using Terraform, the industry-standard infrastructure tool, takes two to three minutes. That delay, once tolerable, has become a critical bottleneck as AI coding assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor can generate working code in seconds.\"When godly intelligence is on tap and can solve any problem in three seconds, those amalgamations of systems become bottlenecks,\" Cooper told VentureBeat. \"What was really cool for humans to deploy in 10 seconds or less is now table stakes for agents.\"The company claims its platform delivers deployments in under one second — fast enough to keep pace with AI-generated code. Customers report a tenfold increase in developer velocity and up to 65 percent cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.These numbers come directly from enterprise clients, not internal benchmarks. Daniel Lobaton, chief technology officer at G2X, a platform serving 100,000 federal contractors, measured deployment speed improvements of seven times faster and an 87 percent cost reduction after migrating to Railway. His infrastructure bill dropped from $15,000 per month to approximately $1,000.\"The work that used to take me a week on our previous infrastructure, I can do in Railway in like a day,\" Lobaton said. \"If I want to spin up a new service and test different architectures, it would take so long on our old setup. In Railway I can launch six services in two minutes.\"Inside the controversial decision to abandon Google Cloud and build data centers from scratchWhat distinguishes Railway from competitors like Render and Fly.io is the depth of its vertical integration. In 2024, the company made the unusual decision to abandon Google Cloud entirely and build its own data centers, a move that echoes the famous Alan Kay maxim: \"People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.\"\"We wanted to design hardware in a way where we could build a differentiated experience,\" Cooper said. \"Having full control over the network, compute, and storage layers lets us do really fast build and deploy loops, the kind that allows us to move at 'agentic speed' while staying 100 percent the smoothest ride in town.\"The approach paid dividends during recent widespread outages that affected major cloud providers — Railway remained online throughout.This soup-to-nuts control enables pricing that undercuts the hyperscalers by roughly 50 percent and newer cloud startups by three to four times. Railway charges by the second for actual compute usage: $0.00000386 per gigabyte-second of memory, $0.00000772 per vCPU-second, and $0.00000006 per gigabyte-second of storage. There are no charges for idle virtual machines — a stark contrast to the traditional cloud model where customers pay for provisioned capacity whether they use it or not.\"The conventional wisdom is that the big guys have economies of scale to offer better pricing,\" Cooper noted. \"But when they're charging for VMs that usually sit idle in the cloud, and we've purpose-built everything to fit much more density on these machines, you have a big opportunity.\"How 30 employees built a platform generating tens of millions in annual revenueRailway has achieved its scale with a team of just 30 employees generating tens of millions in annual revenue — a ratio of revenue per employee that would be exceptional even for established software companies. The company grew revenue 3.5 times last year and continues to expand at 15 percent month-over-month.Cooper emphasized that the fundraise was strategic rather than necessary. \"We're default alive; there's no reason for us to raise money,\" he said. \"We raised because we see a massive opportunity to accelerate, not because we needed to survive.\"The company hired its first salesperson only last year and employs just two solutions engineers. Nearly all of Railway's two million users discovered the platform through word of mouth — developers telling other developers about a tool that actually works.\"We basically did the standard engineering thing: if you build it, they will come,\" Cooper recalled. \"And to some degree, they came.\"From side projects to Fortune 500 deployments: Railway's unlikely corporate expansionDespite its grassroots developer community, Railway has made significant inroads into large organizations. The company claims that 31 percent of Fortune 500 companies now use its platform, though deployments range from company-wide infrastructure to individual team projects.Notable customers include Bilt, the loyalty program company; Intuit's GoCo subsidiary; TripAdvisor's Cruise Critic; and MGM Resorts. Kernel, a Y Combinator-backed startup providing AI infrastructure to over 1,000 companies, runs its entire customer-facing system on Railway for $444 per month.\"At my previous company Clever, which sold for $500 million, I had six full-time engineers just managing AWS,\" said Rafael Garcia, Kernel's chief technology officer. \"Now I have six engineers total, and they all focus on product. Railway is exactly the tool I wish I had in 2012.\"For enterprise customers, Railway offers security certifications including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and HIPAA readiness, with business associate agreements available upon request. The platform provides single sign-on authentication, comprehensive audit logs, and the option to deploy within a customer's existing cloud environment through a \"bring your own cloud\" configuration.Enterprise pricing starts at custom levels, with specific add-ons for extended log retention ($200 monthly), HIPAA BAAs ($1,000), enterprise support with SLOs ($2,000), and dedicated virtual machines ($10,000).The startup's bold strategy to take on Amazon, Google, and a new generation of cloud rivalsRailway enters a crowded market that includes not only the hyperscale cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—but also a growing cohort of developer-focused platforms like Vercel, Render, Fly.io, and Heroku.Cooper argues that Railway's competitors fall into two camps, neither of which has fully committed to the new infrastructure model that AI demands.\"The hyperscalers have two competing systems, and they haven't gone all-in on the new model because their legacy revenue stream is still printing money,\" he observed. \"They have this mammoth pool of cash coming from people who provision a VM, use maybe 10 percent of it, and still pay for the whole thing. To what end are they actually interested in going all the way in on a new experience if they don't really need to?\"Against startup competitors, Railway differentiates by covering the full infrastructure stack. \"We're not just containers; we've got VM primitives, stateful storage, virtual private networking, automated load balancing,\" Cooper said. \"And we wrap all of this in an absurdly easy-to-use UI, with agentic primitives so agents can move 1,000 times faster.\"The platform supports databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis; provides up to 256 terabytes of persistent storage with over 100,000 input/output operations per second; and enables deployment to four global regions spanning the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Enterprise customers can scale to 112 vCPUs and 2 terabytes of RAM per service.Why investors are betting that AI will create a thousand times more software than exists todayRailway's fundraise reflects broader investor enthusiasm for companies positioned to benefit from the AI coding revolution. As tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude become standard fixtures in developer workflows, the volume of code being written — and the infrastructure needed to run it — is expanding dramatically.\"The amount of software that's going to come online over the next five years is unfathomable compared to what existed before — we're talking a thousand times more software,\" Cooper predicted. \"All of that has to run somewhere.\"The company has already integrated directly with AI systems, building what Cooper calls \"loops where Claude can hook in, call deployments, and analyze infrastructure automatically.\" Railway released a Model Context Protocol server in August 2025 that allows AI coding agents to deploy applications and manage infrastructure directly from code editors.\"The notion of a developer is melting before our eyes,\" Cooper said. \"You don't have to be an engineer to engineer things anymore — you just need critical thinking and the ability to analyze things in a systems capacity.\"What Railway plans to do with $100 million and zero marketing experienceRailway plans to use the new capital to expand its global data center footprint, grow its team beyond 30 employees, and build what Cooper described as a proper go-to-market operation for the first time in the company's five-year history.\"One of my mentors said you raise money when you can change the trajectory of the business,\" Cooper explained. \"We've built all the required substrate to scale indefinitely; what's been holding us back is simply talking about it. 2026 is the year we play on the world stage.\"The company's investor roster reads like a who's who of developer infrastructure. Angel investors include Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Guillermo Rauch, chief executive of Vercel; Spencer Kimball, chief executive of Cockroach Labs; Olivier Pomel, chief executive of Datadog; and Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear.The timing of Railway's expansion coincides with what many in Silicon Valley view as a fundamental shift in how software gets made. Coding assistants are no longer experimental curiosities — they have become essential tools that millions of developers rely on daily. Each line of AI-generated code needs somewhere to run, and the incumbents, by Cooper's telling, are too wedded to their existing business models to fully capitalize on the moment.Whether Railway can translate developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise adoption remains an open question. The cloud infrastructure market is littered with promising startups that failed to break the grip of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. But Cooper, who previously worked as a software engineer at Wolfram Alpha, Bloomberg, and Uber before founding Railway in 2020, seems unfazed by the scale of his ambition.\"In five years, Railway [will be] the place where software gets created and evolved, period,\" he said. \"Deploy instantly, scale infinitely, with zero friction. That's the prize worth playing for, and there's no bigger one on offer.\"For a company that built a $100 million business by doing the opposite of what conventional startup wisdom dictates — no marketing, no sales team, no venture hype—the real test begins now. Railway spent five years proving that developers would find a better mousetrap on their own. The next five will determine whether the rest of the world is ready to get on board.",
