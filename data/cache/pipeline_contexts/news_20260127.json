      "content": "Chinese AI and tech firms continue to impress with their development of cutting-edge, state-of-the-art AI language models.Today, the one drawing eyeballs is Alibaba Cloud's Qwen Team of AI researchers and its unveiling of a new proprietary language reasoning model, Qwen3-Max-Thinking.You may recall, as VentureBeat covered last year, that Qwen has made a name for itself in the fast-moving global AI marketplace by shipping a variety of powerful, open source models in various modalities, from text to image to spoken audio. The company even earned an endorsement from U.S. tech lodgings giant Airbnb, whose CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky said the company was relying on Qwen's free, open source models as a more affordable alternative to U.S. offerings like those of OpenAI.Now, with the proprietary Qwen3-Max-Thinking, the Qwen Team is aiming to match and, in some cases, outpace the reasoning capabilities of GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro through architectural efficiency and agentic autonomy.The release comes at a critical juncture. Western labs have largely defined the \"reasoning\" category (often dubbed \"System 2\" logic), but Qwen’s latest benchmarks suggest the gap has closed. In addition, the company's relatively affordable API pricing strategy aggressively targets enterprise adoption. However, as it is a Chinese model, some U.S. firms with strict national security requirements and considerations may be wary of adopting it.The Architecture: \"Test-Time Scaling\" RedefinedThe core innovation driving Qwen3-Max-Thinking is a departure from standard inference methods. While most models generate tokens linearly, Qwen3 utilizes a \"heavy mode\" driven by a technique known as \"Test-time scaling.\"In simple terms, this technique allows the model to trade compute for intelligence. But unlike naive \"best-of-N\" sampling—where a model might generate 100 answers and pick the best one — Qwen3-Max-Thinking employs an experience-cumulative, multi-round strategy.This approach mimics human problem-solving. When the model encounters a complex query, it doesn't just guess; it engages in iterative self-reflection. It uses a proprietary \"take-experience\" mechanism to distill insights from previous reasoning steps. This allows the model to:Identify Dead Ends: Recognize when a line of reasoning is failing without needing to fully traverse it.Focus Compute: Redirect processing power toward \"unresolved uncertainties\" rather than re-deriving known conclusions.The efficiency gains are tangible. By avoiding redundant reasoning, the model integrates richer historical context into the same window. The Qwen team reports that this method drove massive performance jumps without exploding token costs:GPQA (PhD-level science): Scores improved from 90.3 to 92.8.LiveCodeBench v6: Performance jumped from 88.0 to 91.4.Beyond Pure Thought: Adaptive ToolingWhile \"thinking\" models are powerful, they have historically been siloed — great at math, but poor at browsing the web or running code. Qwen3-Max-Thinking bridges this gap by effectively integrating \"thinking and non-thinking modes\".The model features adaptive tool-use capabilities, meaning it autonomously selects the right tool for the job without manual user prompting. It can seamlessly toggle between:Web Search & Extraction: For real-time factual queries.Memory: To store and recall user-specific context.Code Interpreter: To write and execute Python snippets for computational tasks.In \"Thinking Mode,\" the model supports these tools simultaneously. This capability is critical for enterprise applications where a model might need to verify a fact (Search), calculate a projection (Code Interpreter), and then reason about the strategic implication (Thinking) all in one turn.Empirically, the team notes that this combination \"effectively mitigates hallucinations,\" as the model can ground its reasoning in verifiable external data rather than relying solely on its training weights.Benchmark Analysis: The Data StoryQwen is not shy about direct comparisons. On HMMT Feb 25, a rigorous reasoning benchmark, Qwen3-Max-Thinking scored 98.0, edging out Gemini 3 Pro (97.5) and significantly leading DeepSeek V3.2 (92.5).However, the most significant signal for developers is arguably Agentic Search. On \"Humanity's Last Exam\" (HLE) — the benchmark that measures performance on 3,000 \"Google-proof\" graduate-level questions across math, science, computer science, humanities and engineering — Qwen3-Max-Thinking, equipped with web search tools, scored 49.8, beating both Gemini 3 Pro (45.8) and GPT-5.2-Thinking (45.5) . This suggests that Qwen3-Max-Thinking’s architecture is uniquely suited for complex, multi-step agentic workflows where external data retrieval is necessary. In coding tasks, the model also shines. On Arena-Hard v2, it posted a score of 90.2, leaving competitors like Claude-Opus-4.5 (76.7) far behind.The Economics of Reasoning: Pricing BreakdownFor the first time, we have a clear look at the economics of Qwen's top-tier reasoning model. Alibaba Cloud has positioned qwen3-max-2026-01-23 as a premium but accessible offering on its API.Input: $1.20 per 1 million tokens (for standard contexts <= 32k).Output: $6.00 per 1 million tokens.On a base level, here's how Qwen3-Max-Thinking stacks up:ModelInput (/1M)Output (/1M)Total CostSourceQwen 3 Turbo$0.05$0.20$0.25Alibaba CloudGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIdeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekdeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekQwen 3 Plus$0.40$1.20$1.60Alibaba CloudERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40$4.25QianfanGemini 3 Flash Preview$0.50$3.00$3.50GoogleClaude Haiku 4.5$1.00$5.00$6.00AnthropicQwen3-Max Thinking (2026-01-23)$1.20$6.00$7.20Alibaba CloudGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)$2.00$12.00$14.00GoogleGPT-5.2$1.75$14.00$15.75OpenAIClaude Sonnet 4.5$3.00$15.00$18.00AnthropicGemini 3 Pro (>200K)$4.00$18.00$22.00GoogleClaude Opus 4.5$5.00$25.00$30.00AnthropicGPT-5.2 Pro$21.00$168.00$189.00OpenAIThis pricing structure is aggressive, undercutting many legacy flagship models while offering state-of-the-art performance. However, developers should note the granular pricing for the new agentic capabilities, as Qwen separates the cost of \"thinking\" (tokens) from the cost of \"doing\" (tool use).Agent Search Strategy: Both standard search_strategy:agent and the more advanced search_strategy:agent_max are priced at $10 per 1,000 calls.Note: The agent_max strategy is currently marked as a \"Limited Time Offer,\" suggesting its price may rise later.Web Search: Priced at $10 per 1,000 calls via the Responses API.Promotional Free Tier:To encourage adoption of its most advanced features, Alibaba Cloud is currently offering two key tools for free for a limited time:Web Extractor: Free (Limited Time).Code Interpreter: Free (Limited Time).This pricing model (low token cost + à la carte tool pricing) allows developers to build complex agents that are cost-effective for text processing, while paying a premium only when external actions—like a live web search—are explicitly triggered.Developer EcosystemRecognizing that performance is useless without integration, Alibaba Cloud has ensured Qwen3-Max-Thinking is drop-in ready.OpenAI Compatibility: The API supports the standard OpenAI format, allowing teams to switch models by simply changing the base_url and model name.Anthropic Compatibility: In a savvy move to capture the coding market, the API also supports the Anthropic protocol. This makes Qwen3-Max-Thinking compatible with Claude Code, a popular agentic coding environment.The VerdictQwen3-Max-Thinking represents a maturation of the AI market in 2026. It moves the conversation beyond \"who has the smartest chatbot\" to \"who has the most capable agent.\" By combining high-efficiency reasoning with adaptive, autonomous tool use—and pricing it to move—Qwen has firmly established itself as a top-tier contender for the enterprise AI throne.For developers and enterprises, the \"Limited Time Free\" windows on Code Interpreter and Web Extractor suggest now is the time to experiment. The reasoning wars are far from over, but Qwen has just deployed a very heavy hitter.",

      "content": "Anthropic announced Monday that users can now open and interact with popular business applications directly inside Claude, the company's AI assistant—a significant expansion that transforms the chatbot from a conversational tool into an integrated workspace where employees can build project timelines, draft Slack messages, create presentations, and visualize data without switching browser tabs.The rollout, which goes live today, includes integrations with Amplitude, Asana, Box, Canva, Clay, Figma, Hex, Monday.com, and Slack. Salesforce integration is coming soon. The feature marks a new chapter in Anthropic's aggressive push to dominate enterprise AI, arriving just days after the company's CEO made headlines at Davos with bold predictions about AI replacing white-collar workers.\"MCP Apps are an extension to the core MCP protocol and are part of the open source MCP ecosystem,\" Sean Strong, Anthropic's product manager for MCP Apps, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview. \"Within Claude.ai, connectors require a paid Claude plan — Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise — but there is no additional charge associated with using connectors.\"That pricing decision is notable. Rather than monetizing integrations separately or charging partners for distribution, Anthropic is bundling interactive tools into existing subscription tiers — a strategy designed to accelerate adoption and deepen Claude's foothold in corporate environments where the company reportedly already leads OpenAI.Inside MCP Apps, the open-source technology that lets Claude control your favorite work toolsThe technical foundation is what Anthropic calls \"MCP Apps,\" a new extension to the Model Context Protocol, the open standard for connecting external tools to AI applications that Anthropic open-sourced last year. MCP Apps allow any MCP server to deliver an interactive user interface within any supporting AI product—meaning the technology isn't limited to Claude.In practice, the integrations allow for surprisingly granular control. Users can build analytics charts in Amplitude and adjust parameters interactively to explore trends. They can turn conversations into Asana projects with tasks and timelines that sync automatically. They can prompt Claude to generate flowcharts or Gantt charts in Figma's collaborative whiteboard tool, FigJam. They can draft Slack messages, preview formatting, and review before posting.The Hex integration may prove particularly valuable for data teams: users can ask data questions in natural language and receive answers complete with interactive charts, tables, and citations — effectively turning Claude into a business intelligence interface.\"We open sourced MCP to give the ecosystem a universal way to connect tools to AI,\" the company said in its announcement blog. \"Now we're extending MCP further so developers can build interactive UI on top of it, wherever their users are.\"What happens when AI can send messages and create projects on your behalfWith AI systems increasingly capable of taking real-world actions — sending messages, creating projects, publishing content — the question of guardrails becomes critical. Can an employee accidentally send an unreviewed Slack message or publish an incomplete Canva presentation?Strong addressed this directly. \"Most major MCP clients, including Claude, provide consent prompts that help users determine if they want to take an action via a MCP server,\" he said.For enterprise deployments, IT administrators retain control. \"Team and Enterprise admins have the ability to control which MCP servers users in their organizations have the ability to use,\" Strong explained.The consent-prompt approach is a middle ground between full autonomy and cumbersome approval workflows. But it also places significant responsibility on individual users to review actions before confirming them — a design choice that may draw scrutiny as AI agents become capable of more consequential decisions.The security concerns are not hypothetical. As Fortune reported last week, Anthropic's Claude Code product faces vulnerabilities including \"prompt injections,\" where attackers hide malicious instructions in web content to manipulate AI behavior. The company has implemented multiple security layers, including running some features in virtual machines and adding deletion protection after users accidentally removed files. \"Agent safety—that is, the task of securing Claude's real-world actions—is still an active area of development in the industry,\" Anthropic has acknowledged.Claude Code's viral success set the stage for Anthropic's enterprise ambitionsThe interactive tools announcement arrives at a moment of unusual momentum for Anthropic. Claude Code, the company's coding assistant released in February 2024, has become a viral hit that has captured attention far beyond its intended developer audience.Originally built for software developers, Claude Code has captured attention far beyond its intended audience. Non-programmers have deployed it to book theater tickets, file taxes, and monitor tomato plants. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called it \"incredible.\" Even Microsoft, which sells the competing GitHub Copilot, has widely adopted Claude Code internally, with non-developers reportedly encouraged to use it.Boris Cherny, Anthropic's head of Claude Code, told Fortune that his team built Cowork — a user-friendly version of the coding product for non-programmers — in approximately a week and a half, largely using Claude Code itself. \"Engineers just feel unshackled, that they don't have to work on all the tedious stuff anymore,\" Cherny said.Claude Code is now used by Uber, Netflix, Spotify, Salesforce, Accenture, and Snowflake, according to Anthropic. Claude's total web audience has more than doubled since December 2024, and daily unique visitors on desktop are up 12% globally year-to-date, according to data from Similarweb and Sensor Tower published by The Wall Street Journal.The company is also reportedly planning a $10 billion fundraising round that would value Anthropic at $350 billion — a staggering figure that reflects investor confidence in the company's enterprise traction.Anthropic's CEO stirred controversy at Davos with predictions about AI replacing workersThe interactive tools launch also arrives against a backdrop of intense debate about AI's impact on employment — a debate that Anthropic's own CEO helped intensify at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.Dario Amodei told a Davos audience that AI models would replace the work of all software developers within a year and would reach \"Nobel-level\" scientific research in multiple fields within two years. He predicted that 50% of white-collar jobs would disappear within five years.\"I have engineers within Anthropic who say 'I don't write any code anymore. I just let the model write the code, I edit it,'\" Amodei said. \"We might be six to 12 months away from when the model is doing most, maybe all of what software engineers do end-to-end.\"Not everyone agrees with that timeline. Demis Hassabis, the Nobel Prize-winning CEO of Google DeepMind, said at the same conference that today's AI systems are \"nowhere near\" human-level artificial general intelligence. Yann LeCun, the Turing Award-winning AI pioneer who recently left Meta to found Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, went further, arguing that large language models \"will never be able to achieve humanlike intelligence\" and that a completely different approach is needed.Why embedding AI into daily workflows could create powerful lock-in for enterprisesAnthropic's integration strategy reflects a broader shift in enterprise AI competition. The battleground is moving from model benchmarks and capability demonstrations toward workflow integration — the degree to which AI systems become embedded in how companies actually operate.By making Claude the interface through which employees interact with Asana, Slack, Figma, and other daily tools, Anthropic is positioning itself not merely as an AI provider but as a workflow orchestration layer. The more actions that flow through Claude, the harder it becomes for enterprises to switch to a competitor.This approach mirrors strategies that proved successful for earlier generations of enterprise software. Salesforce built its dominance partly by becoming the system of record for customer data. Slack grew by centralizing workplace communication. Anthropic appears to be betting that AI assistants can occupy a similar position — the default starting point for work itself.The open-source foundation of MCP may accelerate this strategy. By making the protocol available to any developer, Anthropic encourages a broad ecosystem of integrations that all funnel through MCP-compatible clients — of which Claude is the most prominent. The company benefits from network effects even as it maintains the standard is open.The race to become the operating system for AI-powered work is just getting startedThe launch notably excludes some major enterprise platforms. Salesforce integration is listed as \"coming soon,\" and there's no mention of Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, or other productivity suites that dominate corporate environments. Those gaps may limit initial adoption in organizations heavily invested in those ecosystems.The feature is available on web and desktop for paid Claude plans, with support for Claude Cowork — the file management agent launched last week — coming later. Mobile support was not mentioned in the announcement.For enterprises evaluating Claude against OpenAI's offerings and other competitors, the interactive integrations represent a tangible differentiator. The ability to take action within business tools — rather than simply generating text that users must copy elsewhere — addresses a persistent friction point in AI adoption.Whether that advantage proves durable depends on how quickly competitors respond. OpenAI has its own enterprise ambitions and partnerships. Google is integrating Gemini across its productivity suite. Microsoft continues to deepen Copilot's presence in Office applications.But the larger significance may be what today's announcement signals about where enterprise software is headed. For decades, the default unit of work has been the application — the spreadsheet, the project tracker, the messaging platform. Anthropic is wagering that the future belongs to the AI layer that sits above them all.If the company is right, the question for every enterprise software vendor becomes uncomfortably simple: Do you want to be the tool, or the thing that controls the tools?",

      "content": "Your web gateway can't see it. Your cloud access broker can't see it. Your endpoint protection can't see it. And yet 95% of organizations experienced browser-based attacks last year, according to Omdia research conducted across more than 1,000 IT and security leaders.Still, three campaigns in 12 months are making the threat more concrete. ShadyPanda infected 4.3 million users through extensions that had been legitimate for seven years. Cyberhaven's security extension was weaponized against 400,000 corporate customers on Christmas Eve. Trust Wallet lost $8.5 million from 2,520 wallets in 48 hours. None triggered traditional alerts.The pattern is consistent: Attackers aren’t exploiting zero-days or bypassing perimeter defenses. They’re operating inside trusted browser sessions — where traditional security tools lose visibility after login.\"Let's be honest, people are using a browser the majority of their day anyway,\" said Sam Evans, CISO of Clearwater Analytics. \"Having the major security component in the browser has made our lives very simple.\" That convenience is exactly what makes the browser the highest-risk execution environment enterprises still treat as infrastructure, not attack surface.VentureBeat recently spoke with Elia Zaitsev, CTO of CrowdStrike, about what's driving these attacks. \"The browser has become a prime target because modern adversaries don't break in, they log in,\" he said. He added that as work, communication, and AI usage move into the browser, attackers increasingly operate inside trusted sessions, abusing valid identities, tokens, and access. Traditional security controls were never designed to stop this kind of activity because they assume \"trust-once\" access is granted and lack visibility into what happens inside live browser sessions.What traditional security architectures missTraditional enterprise security stacks were built to inspect traffic before authentication, not behavior after access is granted. Interviews with CISOs already running browser-layer controls reveal six operational patterns that consistently reduce exposure — assuming identity and endpoint foundations are in place.The Omdia research quantifies the gap: 64% of encrypted traffic goes uninspected, and 65% of organizations lack control over data shared in AI tools, according to the study. LayerX's Enterprise Browser Extension Security Report 2025 found that 99% of enterprise users have at least one browser extension, 53% with high or critical permissions granting access to cookies, passwords, and page content. Another 17% come from non-official stores, and 26% were sideloaded without IT knowing.\"Traditional endpoint detection products were using some machine learning, and they would get to a probability of maybe 85%,\" Evans told VentureBeat. \"This could be a threat, but we're not really sure. How do we take action? Should I pull the fire alarm?\"\"At the end of the day, it's the device the person uses day in and day out that carries the highest risk,\" he said.\"For a long time, the browser was treated as a window, not an execution layer,\" Zaitsev said. \"It was designed for searches and static web access, not for running core business applications or autonomous AI workflows. That's changed dramatically. Today, SaaS applications, cloud identities, AI tools, and agentic workflows all run through the browser, making it the first line of enterprise execution and defense.\"Browser isolation from Menlo Security, Cloudflare, and Symantec addresses rendering threats by executing web content in remote containers. But thousands of extensions now run locally with privileged access, GenAI tools create new exfiltration paths, and session-based attacks hijack authenticated tokens. Isolation protects users before authentication — not after attackers inherit valid sessions, tokens, and extension privileges.Three attack patterns worth understandingTrust can be accumulated over years — then weaponized overnight.The long game. ShadyPanda submitted clean extensions to Chrome and Edge stores in 2018, accumulated Google's \"Featured\" and \"Verified\" badges, then weaponized them seven years later. Clean Master became a remote code execution backdoor running hourly JavaScript downloads — not malware with a fixed function, but a backdoor letting attackers decide what comes next.The credential hijack. Browser auto-updates function as a software supply chain — and inherit its risks. Cyberhaven attackers phished one developer's credentials in 2024. The Chrome Web Store approved the malicious upload. Within 48 hours, 400,000 corporate customers had auto-updated to compromised code.The API key leak. Control planes are attack surfaces, not internal safeguards. Trust Wallet attackers used a leaked Chrome Web Store API key to push malicious updates, bypassing all internal release controls. Around $8.5 million had been drained from wallets by attackers within a couple days. No phishing required. No zero-days. Just the auto-update mechanism doing what it was designed to do.Why detection fails when attackers have valid credentials\"Nation-state actors typically exploit browser access for long-term, covert intelligence collection, while financially motivated e-crime groups prioritize speed, using browser-based attacks to harvest credentials, session tokens, and sensitive data for rapid monetization or resale,\" Zaitsev said. \"Despite different objectives, both rely on the same browser-layer blind spot to operate inside trusted sessions and bypass traditional detection.\"Session hijacking illustrates why this matters. The most important signals are behavioral and contextual, not credentials themselves. That includes how a user interacts with the browser in real-time, whether actions align with expected behavior, how data is being accessed or moved, and whether the session context suddenly changes in ways that indicate abuse.Once attackers capture a valid token, they replay it from anywhere. Authentication already happened, and MFA already passed. Zaitsev argues that detecting session hijacking early requires correlating in-session browser behavior with identity posture, endpoint signals, and threat intelligence. When those signals are unified, distinguishing a legitimate user from a hijacker becomes possible. That's something siloed enterprise browsers and legacy security tools can't see.When productivity tools become exfiltration pathsGenAI traffic surged 890% in 2024, with organizations now averaging 66 GenAI applications, according to Palo Alto Networks' State of Generative AI 2025 report. GenAI-related data loss incidents more than doubled, accounting for 14% of all data security incidents.Evans remembers the board conversation that started it all. \"In October 2023, they asked, 'What are your thoughts on ChatGPT?' I said it's an incredible productivity tool, however, I don't know how we could let our employees use it, because my biggest fear is somebody copies and pastes customer data into it or our source code.\"Legitimate GenAI use and data exfiltration look identical at the network level. Both are encrypted browser sessions sending data to approved SaaS endpoints, often involving copy-and-paste into browser-based tools. The distinction only becomes clear at the browser layer, where you can see what data is being pasted, whether the destination is approved, and whether the behavior matches normal work patterns.Evans found a balance. \"If somebody goes to chatgpt.com, we allow them to use it. They just can't copy and paste anything into it. They can't upload any files, but they can ask questions and compare answers with our corporate version.\" Employees get AI for research without risking customer data in model training.\"It seems like there's a new one every five minutes,\" Evans said. \"Browser-layer controls maintain those categories, so if a new tool shows up, we can feel pretty good that employees won't be able to copy and paste or upload our data.\"The billion-dollar browser betCrowdStrike acquired Seraphic Security and SGNL for a combined $1.16 billion in January 2026, signaling how seriously vendors are betting on the browser layer. Palo Alto Networks bought Talon in 2023. Two camps are emerging. Island wants enterprises to replace Chrome and Edge entirely with a purpose-built browser, and has reached a $4.8 billion valuation (March, 2025). Menlo Security bets most enterprises won't switch browsers, so it layers protection on top of whatever employees already use. The tradeoff is real. Replacement browsers offer deeper control but require adoption. Security layers preserve user choice but see less. Both are winning deals.Zaitsev says neither approach works without tying browser activity to identity. Authentication tells you who logged in. It doesn't tell you if that session gets hijacked 10 minutes later, or if the user starts exfiltrating data to an unauthorized GenAI tool. Catching that requires correlating browser behavior with endpoint and identity signals in real time — something most enterprises can't do yet.For buyers, the decision isn’t about vendors — it’s about whether browser activity is tied into identity, endpoint, and SOC workflows, or left as a standalone control plane.Six patterns from productionSecuring the browser that employees actually use matters more than which enterprise browser to deploy. Today's workforce moves across multiple browsers and managed and unmanaged devices. What matters is visibility and control inside live sessions without breaking how people work.Evans put it more simply: \"I wanted security closer to the end user, on the device they use every day. Having security in the browser made our lives simple. Road warriors dealing with hotel captive portals that normally get blocked by edge products? We don't worry about that anymore.\"Based on interviews with CISOs running browser-layer controls in production, six patterns keep showing up. One caveat: These assume you already have mature identity and endpoint infrastructure. If you don't, start there.Build a complete extension inventory. Use browser management APIs to enumerate every extension, flag anything requesting sensitive permissions, and cross-reference against known-malicious hashes.Break the auto-update kill chain. Fast patching reduces exposure to known vulnerabilities but creates supply chain risk. Implement version pinning with 48- to 72-hour delays. The Cyberhaven attack was detected in roughly 25 hours. A staged rollout would have contained it.Move data protection to where data moves. \"DLP is where we got the biggest win,\" Evans said. \"Customer data exfiltration can happen through social media, personal file shares, and web-based email. Being able to block copy-paste into certain site categories, block file uploads was incredibly powerful.\"Eliminate browser sprawl. \"It does no good to deploy an enterprise browser when someone can download Opera, or Frank's browser of the month, and bypass all the controls,\" Evans said. Every unmanaged browser is a policy-free zone.Extend identity into sessions, treat GenAI as unvetted, feed signals to the SOC. Session hijackers inherit valid credentials but not normal behavior patterns. Watch for impossible travel, permission escalation, and bulk access anomalies. Evans found that browser-layer blocking surfaced shadow AI tools employees actually wanted, which IT could then enable properly. And browser telemetry should flow into existing SOC workflows. \"The AI does initial triage,\" Evans said, \"telling analysts where to look based on what we've seen before.\"Show the board a working demo. \"I didn't just come with concerns,\" Evans said. \"I came with a solution. When I explained how enterprise browsers work, the board said, 'Can you really do it?' At our July 2024 audit committee, they asked how it was going. I said, 'Let me show you.' Pulled up a screenshot — here I am on ChatGPT, tried to paste something, got: 'Policy prevents this.' They said, 'Wow.' That calmed their nerves.\"The bottom lineThe browser security gap is real. The fix isn't necessarily a new platform purchase. Start by assessing what you have: inventory extensions, delay auto-updates, and enforce data policies at the browser layer with existing tools.\"No security tool is 100% perfect,\" Evans said. \"But with browser-layer controls deployed, we sleep a lot easier.\"Breach rates won’t improve by stacking more perimeter tools onto architectures that assume trust ends at login. Outcomes improve when you treat the browser as what it's become: the primary execution environment for enterprise work.",
      "paraphrased_content": "根据Omdia对1000多名IT和安全领导者的调查，去年95%的组织遭受了基于浏览器的攻击，而传统安全工具却未能察觉。ShadyPanda通过七年来合法的扩展感染了430万用户，Cyberhaven在圣诞节前夕将安全扩展武器化，攻击了40万企业客户，Trust Wallet在48小时内因攻击损失了850万美元。这些攻击模式表明，攻击者不是利用零日漏洞或绕过边界防御，而是在传统安全工具登录后失去可见性的可信浏览器会话内操作。\n\n浏览器攻击之所以成功，是因为攻击者在获得信任的会话内滥用有效的身份、令牌和访问权限，而传统安全控制从未设计来阻止这种活动，因为它们假设“信任一次”的访问权限被赋予，并且缺乏对活跃浏览器会话内部发生的事情的可见性。Omdia研究显示，64%的加密流量未被检查，65%的组织缺乏对AI工具中共享数据的控制。LayerX的2025年企业浏览器扩展安全报告发现，99%的企业用户至少有一个浏览器扩展，53%具有高或关键权限，允许访问cookies、密码和页面内容。\n\n对于企业而言，浏览器已成为最高风险的执行环境，但许多企业仍将其视为基础设施而非攻击面。浏览器隔离技术通过在远程容器中执行网络内容来解决渲染威胁，但数千个扩展现在本地运行并具有特权访问权限，GenAI工具创建了新的外泄路径，基于会话的攻击劫持了经过身份验证的令牌。这些技术在身份验证前保护用户，但在攻击者继承了有效会话、令牌和扩展权限后，它们无法提供保护。\n\n浏览器攻击的增加对企业安全策略提出了新的要求。企业需要重新评估其安全架构，特别是在浏览器层面的控制。虽然浏览器隔离技术可以提供一定程度的保护，但它们并不能解决所有问题。企业需要更全面地了解攻击模式，并采取更主动的安全措施，以减少基于浏览器的攻击带来的风险。",

      "content": "One of the biggest constraints currently facing AI builders who want to deploy agents in service of their individual or enterprise goals is the \"working memory\" required to manage complex, multi-stage engineering projects.Typically, when a AI agent operates purely on a stream of text or voice-based conversation, it lacks the structural permanence to handle dependencies. It knows what to do, but it often forgets why it is doing it, or in what order.With the release of Tasks for Claude Code (introduced in v2.1.16) last week, Anthropic has introduced a solution that is less about \"AI magic\" and more about sound software engineering principles. By moving from ephemeral \"To-dos\" to persistent \"Tasks,\" the company is fundamentally re-architecting how the model interacts with time, complexity, and system resources.This update transforms the tool from a reactive coding assistant into a state-aware project manager, creating the infrastructure necessary to execute the sophisticated workflows outlined in Anthropic's just-released Best Practices guide, while recent changelog updates (v2.1.19) signal a focus on the stability required for enterprise adoption.The architecture of agency: from ephemeral to persistentTo understand the significance of this release for engineering teams, we must look at the mechanical differences between the old \"To-do\" system and the new \"Task\" primitive.Previously, Claude Code utilized a \"To-do\" list—a lightweight, chat-resident checklist. As Anthropic engineer Thariq Shihipar wrote in an article on X: \"Todos (orange) = 'help Claude remember what to do'.\" These were effective for single-session scripts but fragile for actual engineering. If the session ended, the terminal crashed, or the context window drifted, the plan evaporated.Tasks (Green) introduce a new layer of abstraction designed for \"coordinating work across sessions, subagents, and context windows.\" This is achieved through three key architectural decisions:Dependency Graphs vs. Linear Lists: Unlike a flat Todo list, Tasks support directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). A task can explicitly \"block\" another. As seen in community demonstrations, the system can determine that Task 3 (Run Tests) cannot start until Task 1 (Build API) and Task 2 (Configure Auth) are complete. This enforcement prevents the \"hallucinated completion\" errors common in LLM workflows, where a model attempts to test code it hasn't written yet.Filesystem Persistence & Durability: Anthropic chose a \"UNIX-philosophy\" approach to state management. Rather than locking project state inside a proprietary cloud database, Claude Code writes tasks directly to the user's local filesystem (~/.claude/tasks). This creates durable state. A developer can shut down their terminal, switch machines, or recover from a system crash, and the agent reloads the exact state of the project.  For enterprise teams, this persistence is critical—it means the \"plan\" is now an artifact that can be audited, backed up, or version-controlled, independent of the active session.Orchestration via Environment Variables: The most potent technical unlock is the ability to share state across sessions. By setting the CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID environment variable, developers can point multiple instances of Claude at the same task list. This allows updates to be \"broadcast\" to all active sessions, enabling a level of coordination that was previously impossible without external orchestration tools.Enabling the 'swarm': parallelism and subagentsThe release of Tasks makes the \"Parallel Sessions\" described in Anthropic's Best Practices guide practical. The documentation suggests a Writer/Reviewer pattern that leverages this shared state:Session A (Writer) picks up Task #1 (\"Implement Rate Limiter\").Session A marks it complete.Session B (Reviewer), observing the shared state update, sees Task #2 (\"Review Rate Limiter\") is now unblocked.Session B begins the review in a clean context, unbiased by the generation process.This aligns with the guide's advice to \"fan out\" work across files, using scripts to loop through tasks and call Claude in parallel. Crucially, patch v2.1.17 fixed \"out-of-memory crashes when resuming sessions with heavy subagent usage,\" indicating that Anthropic is actively optimizing the runtime for these high-load, multi-agent scenarios.Enterprise readiness: stability, CI/CD, and controlFor decision-makers evaluating Claude Code for production pipelines, the recent changelogs (v2.1.16–v2.1.19) reveal a focus on reliability and integration.The Best Practices guide explicitly endorses running Claude in Headless Mode (claude -p). This allows engineering teams to integrate the agent into CI/CD pipelines, pre-commit hooks, or data processing scripts.For example, a nightly cron job could instantiate a Claude session to \"Analyze the day's log files for anomalies,\" using a Task list to track progress through different log shards.The move to autonomous agents introduces new failure modes, which recent patches have addressed:Dangling Processes: v2.1.19 fixed an issue where Claude Code processes would hang when the terminal closed; the system now catches EIO errors and ensures a clean exit (using SIGKILL as a fallback).Hardware Compatibility: Fixes for crashes on processors without AVX support ensure broader deployment compatibility.Git Worktrees: Fixes for resume functionality when working across different directories or git worktrees ensure that the \"state\" follows the code, not just the shell session.Recognizing that enterprise workflows cannot turn on a dime, Anthropic introduced the CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TASKS environment variable (v2.1.19). Setting this to false allows teams to opt-out of the new system temporarily, preserving existing workflows while they migrate to the Task-based architecture.The builder's workflow: managing the context economyFor the individual developer, the Task system solves the \"context economy\" problem. Anthropic's documentation warns that \"Claude's context window... is the most important resource to manage,\" and that performance degrades as it fills.Before Tasks, clearing the context was dangerous—you wiped the agent's memory of the overall plan. Now, because the plan is stored on disk, users can follow the best practice of \"aggressive context management.\" Developers can run /clear or /compact to free up tokens for the model's reasoning, without losing the project roadmap.The changelog also highlights quality-of-life improvements for power users building complex scripts:Shorthand Arguments: Users can now access custom command arguments via $0, $1, etc., making it easier to script reusable \"Skills\" (e.g., a /refactor command that takes a filename as an argument).Keybindings: Fully customizable keyboard shortcuts (/keybindings) allow for faster interaction loops.What Tasks means for Claude Code usersWith the introduction of Tasks, Anthropic is signaling that the future of coding agents is a project management.By giving Claude Code a persistent memory, a way to understand dependency, and the stability fixes required for long-running processes, they have moved the tool from a \"copilot\" that sits next to you to a \"subagent\" that can be trusted to run in the background — especially when powered by Anthropic's most performant model, Claude Opus 4.5.It is a technical evolution that acknowledges a simple truth: in the enterprise, the code is cheap; it is the context, the plan, and the reliability that are precious.",
      "paraphrased_content": "Anthropic公司最近推出的Claude Code v2.1.16更新，通过引入'Tasks'功能，显著提升了AI代理处理复杂任务的能力。此次更新从“To-dos”转变为持久的“Tasks”，改变了模型与时间、复杂性和系统资源的交互方式。这一转变使工具从反应式的编程助手转变为具有状态感知的项目管理者，为执行复杂的工作流程提供了基础设施，这对于企业级部署至关重要。\n\n从技术机制来看，'Tasks'通过三个关键的架构决策实现了跨会话、子代理和上下文窗口的工作协调：支持有向无环图(DAGs)的依赖图谱、文件系统持久性和环境变量的协调。这些改进使得任务可以明确地“阻塞”其他任务，防止了常见的“幻觉完成”错误，并且通过UNIX哲学的方式管理状态，增强了任务的持久性和可审计性。\n\n在实际应用场景中，这一更新使得并行会话成为可能，例如，一个会话(Writer)完成编码任务后，另一个会话(Reviewer)可以立即开始代码审查，共享状态的更新使得这种协调无需外部工具即可实现。这不仅提高了软件开发的效率，还降低了错误率，尤其是在需要多步骤协调的复杂工程任务中。\n\n市场意义在于，Anthropic的这一更新为AI在项目管理和工作协调中的应用提供了新的可能性，使得AI代理能够处理更复杂的任务，而不仅仅是简单的命令执行。然而，需要注意的是，虽然这一更新提升了任务管理的灵活性和效率，但在实际操作中可能需要对AI代理的决策和任务执行进行严格的监控和审计，以确保任务的正确性和安全性。",

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.",
      "paraphrased_content": "最近一项系统性评估显示，在医学分类任务中，传统机器学习（ML）模型相较于基于变换器的大型语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs）表现出更优的性能。该研究通过四个公开可用的数据集，覆盖文本和图像模态，对比了传统ML与现代基于变换器的技术。结果显示，传统ML模型在大多数医学分类任务中持续表现最佳，尤其是在结构化文本数据集上。与此形成鲜明对比的是，LoRA调优的Gemma变体在所有文本和图像实验中表现最差，未能从极少的微调中泛化。然而，零样本LLM/VLM管道（Gemini 2.5）在文本任务上表现不佳，但在多类图像任务上显示出与经典ResNet-50基线相匹配的竞争性能。\n\n这项研究揭示了在医学分类领域，传统ML模型因其稳定性和高效性，仍然是最可靠的选择。研究中，传统ML模型在结构化文本数据集上表现突出，而LoRA调优的Gemma变体则因泛化能力不足而表现不佳。这表明，尽管LLMs和VLMs在某些领域展现出潜力，但在医学分类任务中，传统ML模型的可靠性和效率仍然是关键因素。\n\n对医疗行业而言，这项研究的实际影响在于，它强调了在选择AI模型时，应考虑模型的适用性和泛化能力。对于需要处理大量结构化医疗数据的医疗机构，传统ML模型可能因其在这些任务上的卓越表现而成为更合适的选择。然而，需要注意的是，LLMs和VLMs在图像分类任务中展现出一定的竞争力，这可能为未来的多模态医疗AI应用提供新的思路。\n\n市场意义在于，这项研究为医疗AI领域提供了重要的参考，提示我们在追求最新技术的同时，不应忽视传统ML模型的潜力。尽管LLMs和VLMs在某些场景下可能提供新的可能性，但在医学分类等关键任务中，选择经过验证、表现稳定的模型更为重要。然而，这项研究也提示我们，对于参数高效微调（PEFT）等新技术，其效果可能高度依赖于具体的适应策略，因此在实际应用中需谨慎评估。",
