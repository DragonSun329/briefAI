      "url": "https://github.com/chebykinn/browser-code",
      "content": "I’ve been experimenting with embedding an Claude Code/Cursor-style coding agent directly into the browser.At a high level, the agent generates and maintains userscripts and CSS that are re-applied on page load. Rather than just editing DOM via JS in console the agent is treating the page, and the DOM as a file.The models are often trained in RL sandboxes with full access to the filesystem and bash, so they are really good at using it. So to make the agent behave well, I've simulated this environment.The whole state of a page and scripts is implemented as a virtual filesystem hacked on top of browser.local storage. URL is mapped to directories, and the agent starts inside this directory. It has the tools to read/edit files, grep around and a fake bash command that is just used for running scripts and executing JS code.I've tested only with Opus 4.5 so far, and it works pretty reliably.\nThe state of the file system can be synced to the real filesystem, although because Firefox doesn't support Filesystem API, you need to manually import the fs contents first.This agent is really useful for extracting things to CSV, but it's also can be used for fun.Demo: https://x.com/ichebykin/status/2015686974439608607\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46800484\nPoints: 39\n# Comments: 12",

      "url": "https://github.com/rafa-rrayes/SHDL",
      "content": "Hi, everyone!I built SHDL (Simple Hardware Description Language) as an experiment in stripping hardware description down to its absolute fundamentals.In SHDL, there are no arithmetic operators, no implicit bit widths, and no high-level constructs. You build everything explicitly from logic gates and wires, and then compose larger components hierarchically. The goal is not synthesis or performance, but understanding: what digital systems actually look like when abstractions are removed.SHDL is accompanied by PySHDL, a Python interface that lets you load circuits, poke inputs, step the simulation, and observe outputs. Under the hood, SHDL compiles circuits to C for fast execution, but the language itself remains intentionally small and transparent.This is not meant to replace Verilog or VHDL. It’s aimed at: - learning digital logic from first principles - experimenting with HDL and language design - teaching or visualizing how complex hardware emerges from simple gates.I would especially appreciate feedback on: - the language design choices - what feels unnecessarily restrictive vs. educationally valuable - whether this kind of “anti-abstraction” HDL is useful to you.Repo: https://github.com/rafa-rrayes/SHDLPython package: PySHDL on PyPITo make this concrete, here are a few small working examples written in SHDL:1.
