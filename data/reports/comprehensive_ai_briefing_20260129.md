# 2026 AI & Markets: Comprehensive Intelligence Briefing
*January 29, 2026 | Prepared for Dragon*

---

## Executive Summary

**The AI investment cycle is entering year 2-3 of what major banks predict will be a 10+ year adoption wave.** Capital spending has reached unprecedented levels ($125B from Meta alone in 2026), but monetization timelines remain uncertain. Key risks include DeepSeek's February model release potentially triggering another Nvidia-style crash, and sticky US inflation limiting Fed cuts.

### Top Actionable Insights
1. **DeepSeek R2 imminent** — February release could cause $500B+ volatility (hedge accordingly)
2. **Meta CapEx = 0.4% of US GDP** — AI infrastructure is now macro-relevant
3. **Dollar weakness consensus** — JPM, Goldman, BlackRock all bearish USD
4. **Europe contrarian play** — 23% discount to US could narrow to single digits
5. **Power is the new capital** — Data center constraints hit "gigawatt ceiling" in 2026

## Part 1: Macro Outlook

### Growth Forecasts

| Region | Goldman | JPM | Consensus |
|--------|---------|-----|-----------|
| Global | 2.8% | — | 2.5% |
| US | 2.6% | Resilient | 2.0% |
| Eurozone | Improving | Recovery | — |
| China | — | Consumer recovery | — |

**Key Insight (BlackRock):** For the first time, US could break out from long-term 2% trend — AI capital spending contributing 3x historical average to growth.

### Inflation & Rates

| Central Bank | 2026 Outlook | Terminal Rate |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Fed | 1-2 cuts (50-75bps) | 3.5% |
| BOE | Cut to 3.5% by mid-2026 | 3.5% |
| ECB | On hold | — |
| BOJ | **Only DM bank tightening** | 1.0% by YE |

**Risk:** US inflation staying near 3% (not returning to 2%) limits Fed cutting room.

### FX Calls

| Pair | JPM Target | Thesis |
|------|------------|--------|
| EUR/USD | 1.20 (floor 1.15) | Dollar weakness |
| USD/JPY | >160 | Yen weakness, Takaichi policies |
| CNH | Weak | Retains competitiveness |

**Consensus:** Dollar to continue weakening — demand for US assets diminishing.

## Part 2: AI Investment Landscape

### The Hyperscaler Arms Race

| Company | 2026 CapEx | YoY Growth | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|
| Meta | $115-135B | +60-88% | 0.4% of US GDP, 15% of US military budget |
| Microsoft | ~$150B* | ~40%* | Q2 spend: $37.5B, capacity constrained |
| Google | ~$80B* | — | Gemini 3 Flash, Agentic Vision |
| Tesla→xAI | $2B | New | Shareholder opposition |

*Estimates based on run rates

**Zuckerberg Quote:** "Looking forward to advancing personal superintelligence in 2026"

### The DeepSeek Threat

**Timeline:**
- DeepSeek R1 (2025) → $500B+ Nvidia drop, 7-18% tech sympathy sells
- DeepSeek R2/V4 → Expected February (around Spring Festival)
- Two new papers in January on training efficiency — "breakthrough" for scaling

**Performance Expectation:** R2 to match Claude Opus 4.5

**Risk Assessment:**
- Short-term: Potential repeat of R1 volatility
- Long-term: Previous dips recovered as hardware demand proved resilient
- Wildcard: DeepSeek may be pursuing architectural discontinuity, not iteration

### Goldman's 7 AI Themes for 2026

1. **AI models = new operating systems** — Model owners own the OS
2. **Context is the new frontier** — Better memory > larger models
3. **Rise of the personal agent** — Autonomous booking, scheduling, ordering
4. **Agent-as-a-service economy** — Billing by tokens, not hours
5. **Learning = most important skill** — Adaptability over expertise
6. **Winner-takes-most mega partnerships** — Self-reinforcing networks
7. **Power is the new capital** — 175% data center power growth by 2030

### Agentic AI: 2026's Battleground

**What's Shipping:**
- Meta: Agentic commerce tools major rollout
- Google: Agentic Vision for Gemini 3 Flash
- Moonshot: Kimi K2.5 (open-source, HLE 50.2%, BrowseComp 74.9%)

**Industry Reality Check:**
> "2025: Everyone screamed AGI is here!! 2026: We're still debugging agent loops that forget their own name mid-task. The hype died. Utility won."

**Key Insight:** "Prompt Engineer is dead" — Shift from human→AI to AI→AI orchestration (Manager-Worker frameworks)

## Part 3: Equity Strategy

### US Equities

**Goldman:** Lower index returns than 2025, but bull market broadening beyond mega-caps

**JPM:**
- Constructive outlook, 10-25% upside potential
- Stay long large caps + growth style (AI theme)
- "Remaining 493" S&P stocks had best earnings growth in years (+12% Q3)

**BlackRock:** Stay pro-risk, overweight US stocks on AI theme — but active management critical

### European Equities

**Morgan Stanley Bull Case:**
- Broke top of discount range for first time in 10 years (Dec 31)
- Current like-for-like discount: 23% → could narrow to single digits
- Leading AI adopters trading at 27% discount to US equivalents

**Sector Calls:**
- **Long:** Banks (top of model), Defense (rearmament), Utilities (powering AI)
- **Short:** Autos, Chemicals, Luxury, Transport, F&B (old economy, China exposure)

### EM Picks (JPM)
- **Korea** — Semi exposure
- **India** — Friendshoring beneficiary, demographic dividend
- **Brazil** — Commodities

---

## Part 4: Fixed Income & Credit

### Rates Outlook

| Bond | JPM YE Target |
|------|---------------|
| 10Y UST | 4.35% |
| 10Y Bund | 2.75% |
| 10Y Gilt | 4.75% |

**BlackRock:** Tactically underweight long-term US Treasuries — levered system vulnerable to yield spikes

### Credit

**JPM:**
- Spreads to widen modestly (more IG than HY)
- Increased supply from AI ecosystem + M&A/LBO
- **Risk:** AI monetization curve flatter than expected → weaker balance sheets
- High grade returns > high yield (duration effect)

---

## Part 5: Risks & Contrarian Views

### Primary Risks

1. **DeepSeek R2 release** — February shock potential
2. **AI monetization lag** — CapEx front-loaded, revenues back-loaded
3. **Sticky US inflation** — Fed forced to hold or even hike
4. **Power grid constraints** — "Gigawatt ceiling" limiting AI scale-up
5. **Geopolitical** — China-Taiwan, tariff escalation

### Contrarian Takes

**From X/Social Media:**
- "Overhyped in short term (2026-2030) but underhyped in long term (2020-2100)"
- Grifters migrating from crypto to AI
- "AI washing" — regulators cracking down
- Agency from scaling alone is overhyped — advances come via architecture, not just compute

**Real Game-Changers (not hype):**
- Multimodal AI (text + images + code)
- Edge AI (on-device for privacy/speed)

## Part 6: Portfolio Positioning Summary

### Asset Class Views

| Asset | View | Rationale |
|-------|------|-----------|
| US Large Cap | OW | AI theme, earnings growth |
| US "Other 493" | OW | Broadening bull market |
| Europe | Tactical OW | Deep discount, AI adopters |
| EM (Korea/India/Brazil) | Selective OW | Semi/friendshoring/commodities |
| Long UST | UW | Levered system, yield spike risk |
| IG Credit | Neutral+ | Duration > spread risk |
| HY Credit | Neutral- | Widening spreads |
| USD | UW | Weakening consensus |

### Key Hedges to Consider

1. **DeepSeek February hedge** — Puts on NVDA, SMH, QQQ
2. **Inflation hedge** — TIPS, gold, commodities
3. **Dollar weakness** — Long EUR, selective EM FX
4. **Volatility** — VIX calls ahead of tariff/trade announcements
